## Introduction

In recent years, understanding economic indicators has become increasingly crucial for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. This document aims to analyze key economic metrics, including the unemployment rate and employment rate, utilizing data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.

The focus of this analysis will be on trends over the past decade, highlighting significant fluctuations and their implications on the broader economy. By examining the relationships between the unemployment rate and employment rate, we aim to uncover insights that can inform future economic strategies.

Throughout this document, we will utilize visualizations and statistical analyses to present our findings clearly and concisely. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current economic landscape and to foster a deeper understanding of these vital indicators.
