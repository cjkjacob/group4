### Wednesday

#### Cleaning the dataset

Before processing and creating visualizations of the dataset, it is important to prep the dataset by cleaning it. There might be N/A values or outliers in the dataset, which needs to be removed and cleaned to create better and more accurate visualizations.

To clean the data, there are a few things that can be done: - Finding and highlighting NA values by selecting the range of cells and doing 'Conditional Formatting' to 'Highlight Cells Rules'. - Removing NA values by using the 'Find and Replace'. Find 'NA' and replace it with '0'. - Using IF function to check for NA values and replace it accordingly. Ex: =IF(A2="NA", "0", A2)

Additionally, upon converting the Swiss dataset from a .csv format into an Excel, the first column of the dataset became combined into one cell.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_cleaning.png)

I fixed the titles that are separated by commas in the one cell by separating the titles into the different respective columns.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_cleaning2.png)

#### Context of dataset

Before creating plots and visualizations of the dataset, it is important to know what each title in the columns mead and understand the context of the dataset.

<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/swiss.html>

The dataset contains 47 French-speaking "provinces" in Switzerland at around 1888. During that year, Switzerland was entering a demographic transition, where its fertility rates was beginning to fall from the typical level of underdeveloped countries. There are 6 variables in the dataset, where variables are scaled from 0 to 100, except Cathloic that is scaled from 0 to 1. The definitions of the dataset are as below:

-   Fertility = common standardized fertility measure
-   Agriculture = % of males involved in agriculture as occupation
-   Examination = % draftees receiving highest mark on army examination
-   Education = % education beyond primary school for draftees.
-   Catholic = % 'catholic' (as opposed to 'protestant').
-   Infant.Mortality = live births who live less than 1 year.

#### Creating Different Basic Visualizations

##### Scatterplot 1 - Fertility and Cathlic appear to cluster in two groups with four outliers

In creating plots, I utilized Excel's tool of Recommended Charts, which included a scatterplot of 'Fertility' and 'Catholic'. The scatterplot shown below shows two groups of cluster with four outliers.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_scatterplot.png)

As shown in the scatterplot, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic people seem to have a slightly higher fertility compared to provinces with low percentage of Catholic people.

##### Scatterplot 2 - Relationship between infant mortality and percentage of Catholic people in a province

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_scatterplot2.png) Based on the scatterplot above, infant mortality and Catholic appear to have no apparent relationship. However, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic population appear to has a slightly higher infant mortality, with a few provinces having 25 and more live births in a year. Meanwhile, the provinces with a low percentage of Catholic population appear to have infant mortality mostly in the 15-25 range.

Aside from that, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population or a very low percentage of Catholic population, with the scatterplot showing two clusters on the lower end of Catholic percentage (0-20%) and a higher end of Catholic percentage (80-100%). What do you observe?

##### Bar Charts

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_barchart.png) As mentioned in the discussion above, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population, or a very low percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart shows a high frequency within the 2.15-7.15% of Catholic population that gradually decreases as the percentage approaches 17.15-22.15 and gradually increases again as it approaches the 87.15-92.15 percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart above better visualize the two groups of highly populated Catholic province or lowly populated Catholic province.

##### Line Chart

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_linechart.png) The line chart above clearly shows that there is a direct relationship between examination and education. As the percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees increases, the percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination also increases. The two variables showcase a positive directly correlated relationship. Aside from that, the graph also shows that the 46th province outperformed all of the other provinces with the highest percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees and also the highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination. The 46th province is followed by the 42th province which has the second highest percentage of education beyond primary school and second highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination.

##### Pie Charts

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_piechart.png) The pie chart does not really visualize the agriculture data well, as there are too many percentage classification of males involved in agriculture occupation. However, the pie chart can be made better by making the classifications into 5 groups to see which range of percentage of males involved in agriculture occupation is higher among the other provinces.

##### Histograms

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_histogram.png) The histogram shows a slightly negative skew on the frequency of males involved in agriculture as occupation. The majority of the provinces have males involved in agriculture on the 61.2-71.2% range. The 1.2-11.2% range and the 21.2-31.2% range of males involved in agriculture have the lowest frequency.

#### What plot represent better the data? why?

There isn't any plot that is more superior that the other, but it wholly depends on the variables being plotted. For instance, the relationship between examination and education can be better represented using a line chart, as a line chart shows a more visible distinction between the variable of examination and education. If using a scatterplot, the many plots in the chart may cause the distinction between the two variables to be less visible, as the two variables are directly correlated and have values very closely to one another.

On the other hand, using a scatterplot can better highlight the two groups of highly-populated Catholic provinces and lowly-populated Catholic provinces better than a barchart. The scatterplot can visualize the two groups of clusters on opposite ends, highlighting there there are two major groups in the Swiss: Catholic heavily-populated province or Protestant heavily-populated province

Therefore,different plots have different uses and can highlight the relationship of some variables better than the other, depending on the context and relationship of the variables being plotted. It is important to explore the different relationships of variables using different charts and plots to better visualize the relationships of the variables in the dataset.


### Friday

#### Choosing the source and dataset

-   The source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>.

I chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different datasets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.

-   For this assignment, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm on which dataset I should choose from and why.

After using ChatGPT and exploring the source website some more, I decided to choose the dataset containing Corporate Profits by Industry with this link: <https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/6257>. I downloaded the whole data lists, as it all involves the relevant corporate profits of different industries and sub-sectors.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Download_data.png)

-   I think that it would be interesting to visualize how the different industries' profits vary throughout the years, and whether there are correlations between any industries. I downloaded the dataset as Excel format.

#### Context of the dataset

The dataset contains quarterly data on the corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment for different industries, including non-financial, financial, federal, and many other sub-categories such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and utilities. The data is presented in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted annual rate. To set parameter, the study for this assignment only looks at the 10 year span from first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2024.

#### Cleaning and organizing the dataset

1.  Replacing Series ID with Titles

The dataset contains columns with Series ID instead of titles. Therefore, it needs to be replaced with the titles, which can be viewed in the other sheet in the same Excel document. - To do this, I copied the first Series ID and paste it on the 'Find' tool.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Replacing_column_titles.png)

-   Then, I go to the other sheet in the same Excel document to find the same Series ID and locate the title

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Replacing_column_titles2.png)

-   After locating the title, I copied it and paste it on the dataset sheet to replace the Series ID with the right title.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Replacing_column_titles3.png)

-   Repeat this until all other Series ID are replaced with its title

2.  Making the titles more concise When copy and pasting back the titles to the dataset sheet, I realized that the titles are very long and repetitive. Therefore, I reorganized the title and make it shorter and more concise.

3.  Formatting the columns to be more organized and neat To do this, I expanded the columns to the right width, and centered the text. Additionally, I also deleted the rows with data outside of the 10 year span from 2014 to 2024, as it is outside the parameter of the this exploration.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Cleaned_and_organized_data.png)

#### Making Visualizations

In making visualizations, I utilized Excel's 'Recommended Charts' tool under 'Insert'. After using the tool, I looked over the data and explore to create more meaningful visualizations on my own.

##### Line chart: Average Total Profits in 10 Years

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Average_CP.png)

When I added a graph from the 'Recommended Charts', a new sheet is created along with corporate profits summed into yearly instead of quarterly.

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Linechart.png)

-   Total corporate profits increase over the 10 year period.
-   There are some significant declines in corporate profits The two major declines occurred in the span of end of quarter of 2019 to end of quarter of 2020. in the late quarter of 2019 to 2020. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the sudden drop in corporate profits, with the lock-down, inflation, and slowdown of the economy. The economy healed in the first two quarters of 2020 as the lock-downs are alleviated, however declined again in the end of quarter of 2020.
-   The private enterprises' profits appear to be very steadily increasing from first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2024. The total corporate profits appear to be higher than the average total corporate profits dotted line, signifying that the increase in total corporate profits are quite significant.

##### Scatterplot 1: Domestic Industries (Non-financial: Manufacturing) vs. Federal

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Scatterplot1.png)

-   "Domestic Industries: Non-financial: Manufacturing" appears to have an inverse relationship with "Federal"

As 'Manufacturing' is high at a range of 675-825 billion dollars, 'Federal' appears to be on hundreds of billion dollars loss. However, as 'Manufacturing' decreases to below 600 billion dollars, 'Federal's' corporate profits improved to a range of 50-125 billion dollars.

##### Scatterplot 2: Wholesale trade vs. Transportation and warehousing

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Scatterplot2.png)

-   As wholesale trade's corporate profits increases, the corporate profits in the sub-sector of transportation and warehousing also increases.

The direct and proportional relationship of the two sub-sectors make sense, as wholesale trade involves purchasing goods in large quantities and reselling them in smaller quantities to businesses and other wholesalers, directly involving transportation and warehousing of the goods.

##### Barchart: Non-financial vs. Financial Domestic Industry

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Barchart.png)

-   The non-financial domestic industry's corporate profits are growing more significantly compared to the financial domestic industry's stable corporate profits

The non-financial domestic industry are growing more rapidly, especially in the last half of the decade. The financial domestic industry has over 2500 billions of dollars of corporate profits in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, the financial domestic industry appears to have stable corporate profits throughout the past 10 years, as its corporate profits are varying slightly from year to year and are stuck under 750 billion dollars.

##### Piechart: Non-financial makes up the majority of the domestic industry's corporate profits

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Piechart.png)

-   Non-financial domestic industry takes 70% of the domestic industry's corporate profits, while the rest of the world takes up only 14% of the domestic industry's corporate profits.
-   As stated in a study, non-financial corporations are responsible for a large share of the economic activity in most advanced economies (Tebrake & O'hagan, n.d.), which maakes sense as a lot of the important sub-sectors belong to the non-financial industry (including manufacturing of durable and non-durable goods, wholesale trade, retail trade, utilities, and information)

## Week 2 - 09/02 ~ 09/06

### Wednesday and Friday Work

#### Context of data set

I am using the 'airquality' data set, which is the daily air quality measurements in New York from May 1, 1973, to September 30, 1973. The format is a data frame with 153 observations on 6 variables:

1.  **Ozone:** numeric Ozone (ppb)
2.  **Solar.R:** numeric Solar R (lang)
3.  **Wind:** numeric Wind (mph)
4.  **Temp:** numeric Temperature (degrees F)
5.  **Month:** numeric Month (1--12)
6.  **Day:** numeric Day of month (1--31)

**Details:**

-   Ozone: Mean ozone in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt Island

-   Solar.R: Solar radiation in Langleys in the frequency band 4000--7700 Angstroms from 0800 to 1200 hours at Central Park

-   Wind: Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at LaGuardia Airport

-   Temp: Maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport.

**Source and reference:**

The data were obtained from the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).

Chambers, J. M., Cleveland, W. S., Kleiner, B. and Tukey, P. A. (1983) *Graphical Methods for Data Analysis*. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.

#### Uploading and converting the document

-   I downloaded the airquality data set in .csv format from D2L.
-   Then, I uploaded it onto Excel.

Since the format is in .csv, I need to change from 'Viewing' to 'Editing', and convert the Excel into .xlsx format

-   Afterwards, I renamed the Excel file and saved it onto the right folder.

#### Cleaning the data set

Before processing and creating visualizations of the dataset, it is important to prep the data set by cleaning it. There might be N/A values or outliers in the dataset, which needs to be removed and cleaned to create better and more accurate visualizations.

To clean the data, I used Excel to clean the data and remove all the rows which as NA values.

Here are the things I did step by step to clean the data set:

1.  Filtering the data set and checking only the NA values

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Cleaning-filtering_Oenardi.png)

2.  Delete the rows with NA values

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Cleaning-deleting_Oenardi.png)

3.  Repeat on the other columns

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Cleaning2_Oenardi.png)

#### Creating visualizations (Charts + Pivot Tables)

##### Histogram: Ozone Distribution

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Histogram_Ozone_Oenardi.png)

-   The histogram shows a positively skewed (or right-skewed) distribution which most values are clustered around the left tail of the distribution while the right tail of the distribution is longer

-   The mode of the ozone level is 1-25 ppb.

##### Scatter plot: Ozone vs. Temperature

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Scatterplot_Ozone_Temp.png)

-   The scatter plot shows an increasing in trend of both variables. It suggests that ozone depend on temperature, but other factors like the day, month, and solar wind also affect temperature.

-   Ozone and temperature shows a directly related relationship, where the increase in ozone may cause to an increase in temperature.

#### Creating a Pivot Table

1.  Select the data you want to include in the pivot table

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-1_Oenardi.png)

2.  Create pivot table in a new sheet

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-2_Oenardi.png)

3\. Drag 'Month' into the Rows

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-3_Oenardi.png)

4\. Drag 'Day' into Columns

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-4_Oenardi.png)

5\. Drag 'Ozone', 'Solar.R', 'Wind', 'Temp' into Values

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-5_Oenardi.png)

6.  Explore and drag around the variables in different ways to create more insightful pivot tables

##### Pivot Table 1: Average of Variables Summary

Making visualizations in the form of a pivot table allows us to help understand the data set by allowing the data to be presented from another perspective. We can also choose where to put the values on the pivot table to present the data in different ways.

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot-Table1_Summary-Variables_Oenardi.png)

-   **Average Ozone Levels**: Peaks in July (59.1) and August (60.0), while May (24.1) and September (31.4) have the lowest levels.

-   **Average Temperature**: Highest in July (83.9) and August (83.7), with May (66.5) being the coolest.

-   **Average Wind Speed**: Highest in June (12.2) and lowest in July (8.5).

-   **Average Solar Radiation (Solar.R)**: Peaks in July (216.4), and the lowest in September (168.2).

-   Overall, July and August show higher ozone and temperature levels. Ozone and temperature levels appear to have a directly proportional relationship, with average ozone increasing in May to August and decreasing in September, and average temperature following a similar upward and downward trend throughout the months.

-   Average temperature and solar levels appear to also have a directly proportional relationship, as solar directly affects the temperature.

-   On the other hand, wind speed varies inversely with temperature. Wind speed appears to be increasing from May to June, sharply drops in July, and increasing again in August and September.

#### Pivot Table 2: Temperature

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-temp_Oenardi.png)

-   The pivot table allows us to delve more deeply on the average temperature trend throughout the months and days.
-   As seen from the pivot table, the hottest days appear to be on the end of August (August 28 to August 31) to the beginning of September (September 1 to September 4), with the temperature consistently reaching above 90 degrees throughout those days).
-   Meanwhile, the coldest days seem to be in early May, with temperature ranging from 58 degrees to 79 degrees.

#### Pivot Table 3: Temperature vs. Ozone, Wind, and Solar

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_table-temp_vs_all_Oenardi.png)

-   Solar generally increases with temperature and peaks at temperature 86 lang with an average of 211.6 lang. As seen from the chart, solar fluctuates most significantly among other variables, with values ranging from 20 to 298.5 lang.
-   Ozone increases as temperature rises, with notable jumps at 71 degrees (15 ppb), 77 degrees (23 ppb), and peaks at 89 degrees (103.5 ppb).
-   The highest average ozone level is 103.5 ppb at 89 degrees in. Meanwhile, ozone appears to be low (\<30 degrees) for temperatures below 70 degrees, such as in May and September. This further suggests that ozone and temperature has a directly proportional relationship.
-   Wind shows a decreasing trend as the temperature rises. Wind peaks at 18.4 mph for 57 degrees and consistently reduces, reaching as low as 4.3 mph at 93 degrees, which shows that wind and temperature are inversely related.
-   Wind has relatively stable values between 6-10 mph for temperatures above 80 degrees.
-   Higher temperatures correlate with lower wind speeds and increased ozone levels. Meanwhile, solar has a fluctuating trend and does not show a consistent pattern with temperature changes.

#### Bar chart from pivot table

I selected the pivot table and inserted a bar chart using Excel to visualize the relationship of temperature with solar, ozone, and wind by month. ![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_chart-2_Oenardi.png)

-   Ozone shows a steady increase from May (5) to July (7), peaks in August (8), and then decreases in September (9).

-   Temperature increases gradually from May (5) to July (7), maintains a similar level in August (8) and September (9).

-   Wind remains relatively low and stable throughout all months, with slight fluctuations.

-   Solar peaks sharply in May (5) and July (7), slightly decreases in June (6) and August (8), and remains high in September (9). Solar radiation shows high peaks in May and July.

#### Line chart from pivot table

I selected another pivot table and inserted a line chart using Excel to visualize the relationship of temperature with solar, ozone, and wind.

![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Janice/Pivot_chart_Oenardi.png)

-   The pivot table allows us to look more closely on the effect of temperature on the other variables (ozone, wind, and solar).

-   As seen on the pivot table and the line chart, the solar levels fluctuate the most among the other variables and seem to generally increase as temperature approaches 97.

-   Besides that, ozone follow a similar upward trend as temperature increases, suggesting a directly proportional relationship.

-   Additionally, wind appears to be inversely related with temperature, as it decreases when temperature approaches its maximum.

#### Findings and takeaways

What and how does the findings pertains to our overall project objective?

1.  The findings in this assignment allowed me to learn that making visualizations are not just about making different kinds of charts, but also can be in the form of tables -in this case, pivot tables.
2.  Pivot tables are important and can be used strategically to present data from a new set of perspectives by arranging, formatting, and organizing the data in different rows, columns, and values. By presenting the data in a more organized way, we can draw more analysis and correlations of how different variables relate to one another in the data set.
3.  Making a more insightful and in-depth analysis of the data set requires a deep exploration by trying to plot data in different ways, formatting them differently (ex: adjusting the min/max values or the bin range of a chart),

I will incorporate the findings from this assignment into the mid-term project, to allow a better exploration and analysis of the FRED data set. Specifically, aside from making different charts (scatter plots, distribution, line chart, etc.), I will also deeply explore the data set variables through pivot tables. Pivot tables allow us to see the data in a different dimension, which is more concise and summarized for better comprehension. As the FRED data set is huge, pivot tables would be very useful in effectively visualizing and finding meaningful correlations and analyses of the variables.


### Midterm Project Context

#### Choosing the source and dataset

-   The source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>

-   I chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different data sets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.

#### Context of the FRED data source

The FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) data set contains various economic indicators from the U.S., such as employment statistics, inflation rates, GDP data, and other key economic variables. Here's a breakdown of the context of this data set:

##### Variables

As the FRED source contains a lot of different datasets, here are only some of the variables included in the dataset source.

-   GDP (Gross Domestic Product): A measure of the total economic output of a country.
-   Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work.
-   Inflation Rate (CPI or PPI): The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
-   Interest Rates: Such as the Federal Funds Rate, which is the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.
-   Industrial Production Index: A measure of the real output of the manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas industries.
-   Retail Sales: A measure of the total sales within the retail sector.
-   Housing Starts: The number of new residential construction projects that have begun in a given period.
-   Consumer Confidence Index: A measure of consumer sentiment about the economy.
-   Exports and Imports: The total value of goods and services exported and imported by a country.

##### Who collected the data

The data is collected by various U.S. government agencies such as:

-   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

-   The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

-   The Federal Reserve Board

    The U.S. Census Bureau It is then compiled and made available to the public by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis via the FRED platform.

##### Purpose of the source and data set

###### The primary purpose of the FRED data set is to provide economic data that can be used for:

-   Economic Research and Analysis: By economists, policymakers, and academic researchers to understand economic trends and conditions.

-   Policy Making: By government agencies and the Federal Reserve to inform monetary and fiscal policy decisions.

-   Market Analysis: By financial analysts and investors to forecast economic conditions and make informed decisions.

-   Education: As a resource for students and educators in understanding economic principles and trends.

###### There are several objectives/purposes of the data set that can be relevant fo the mid-tern project. I can delve into the economic indicators over time, such as:

-   GDP Growth Rate: To observe economic expansion or contraction.

-   Unemployment Rate: To identify periods of high or low employment.

-   Inflation Rate: To detect inflationary or deflationary trends.

-   Interest Rates: To understand changes in the cost of borrowing.

###### For comparative analysis, I can also use bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pivot charts, and other visualizatioons to compare different indicators:

-   Interest Rates vs. Inflation Rates: To show the relationship between monetary policy and inflation.

-   GDP vs. Unemployment Rate: To show how economic output correlates with employment levels.

-   Consumer Confidence vs. Retail Sales: To visualize how sentiment aligns with spending behavior.

###### For a deeper exploration using the source and data set, I can also create sector-specific visualizations to focus on specific sectors such as manufacturing, housing, or consumer spending:

-   Industrial Production Index: To visualize the output of key industries.

-   Housing Starts: To visualize the health of the real estate sector.

-   Retail Sales by Category: To understand consumer spending patterns.

###### I can create geographical visualizations from different countries that the data set including:

-   Unemployment Rates by Country: To visualize regional differences in employment.

-   GDP Growth by Country: To compare economic performance across different areas.

Additionally, I can delve into leading and lagging Indicators by visualize leading indicators (like consumer confidence) against lagging indicators (like GDP) to understand potential future economic conditions.
