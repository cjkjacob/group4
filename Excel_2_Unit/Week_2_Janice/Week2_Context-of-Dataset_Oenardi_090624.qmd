## Choosing the source and dataset

-   The source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/.

-   I chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different data sets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.

## Context of the FRED data source

The FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) data set contains various economic indicators from the U.S., such as employment statistics, inflation rates, GDP data, and other key economic variables. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the context of this data set:

### Variables

As the FRED source contains a lot of different datasets, here are only some of the variables included in the dataset source.

-   GDP (Gross Domestic Product): A measure of the total economic output of a country.
-   Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work.
-   Inflation Rate (CPI or PPI): The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
-   Interest Rates: Such as the Federal Funds Rate, which is the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.
-   Industrial Production Index: A measure of the real output of the manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas industries.
-   Retail Sales: A measure of the total sales within the retail sector.
-   Housing Starts: The number of new residential construction projects that have begun in a given period.
-   Consumer Confidence Index: A measure of consumer sentiment about the economy.
-   Exports and Imports: The total value of goods and services exported and imported by a country.

### Who collected the data

The data is collected by various U.S. government agencies such as:

-   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

-   The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

-   The Federal Reserve Board

    The U.S. Census Bureau It is then compiled and made available to the public by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis via the FRED platform.

### Purpose of the source and data set

#### The primary purpose of the FRED data set is to provide economic data that can be used for:

-   Economic Research and Analysis: By economists, policymakers, and academic researchers to understand economic trends and conditions.

-   Policy Making: By government agencies and the Federal Reserve to inform monetary and fiscal policy decisions.

-   Market Analysis: By financial analysts and investors to forecast economic conditions and make informed decisions.

-   Education: As a resource for students and educators in understanding economic principles and trends.

#### There are several objectives/purposes of the data set that can be relevant fo the mid-tern project. I can delve into the economic indicators over time, such as:

-   GDP Growth Rate: To observe economic expansion or contraction.

-   Unemployment Rate: To identify periods of high or low employment.

-   Inflation Rate: To detect inflationary or deflationary trends.

-   Interest Rates: To understand changes in the cost of borrowing.

#### For comparative analysis, I can also use bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pivot charts, and other visualizatioons to compare different indicators:

-   Interest Rates vs. Inflation Rates: To show the relationship between monetary policy and inflation.

-   GDP vs. Unemployment Rate: To show how economic output correlates with employment levels.

-   Consumer Confidence vs. Retail Sales: To visualize how sentiment aligns with spending behavior.

#### For a deeper exploration using the source and data set, I can also create sector-specific visualizations to focus on specific sectors such as manufacturing, housing, or consumer spending:

-   Industrial Production Index: To visualize the output of key industries.

-   Housing Starts: To visualize the health of the real estate sector.

-   Retail Sales by Category: To understand consumer spending patterns.

#### I can create geographical visualizations from different countries that the data set including:

-   Unemployment Rates by Country: To visualize regional differences in employment.

-   GDP Growth by Country: To compare economic performance across different areas.

Additionally, I can delve into leading and lagging Indicators by visualize leading indicators (like consumer confidence) against lagging indicators (like GDP) to understand potential future economic conditions.
