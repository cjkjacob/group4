#New York Air Quality Dataset

## **Description**

The dataset contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. It focuses on six key variables related to atmospheric conditions: ozone levels, solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, month, and day. The data helps analyze the relationship between these variables and environmental factors.

### **Variables**

1.  **Ozone** (ppb): Measured between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM at Roosevelt Island.
2.  **Solar.R** (Langleys): Solar radiation measured from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM at Central Park.
3.  **Wind** (mph): Average wind speed at LaGuardia Airport, recorded between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM.
4.  **Temp** (°F): Maximum daily temperature at LaGuardia Airport.
5.  **Month**: Numeric (1 = May, 9 = September).
6.  **Day**: Day of the month.

### **Source**

Data was provided by the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).

#Dataset and Data Cleaning

1.  We revisited the airquality_datasets.csv and created pivot tables.
2.  I Cleaned the data by creating filters and deleting NA values and empty cells, similar to what was done in the first week.

\#**Introduction to Histograms** Professor introduced histograms and their functions, showing their simplicity and effectiveness in presenting data. Exploratory Analysis: Ozone Levels Histogram: The histogram illustrates the variability in ozone levels over time. Key Insights: High ozone levels are notable, but moderate and low levels are more prevalent. Elevated levels are less frequent, while moderate and low concentrations are common.

# **Saving Files and Folder Organization**

We learned how to save files properly for each week to ensure Quarto documents render correctly. Instructions: Save everything in the same folder for efficient document rendering.

\#**Ozone vs. Temperature: Scatter Plot Analysis** The professor demonstrated a scatter plot comparing ozone levels and temperature. Key Insights: Positive correlation: Higher ozone levels generally occur with higher temperatures. Extreme ozone levels (115, 135, 168) appear with temperatures ranging from 79 to 97. Moderate ozone levels occur between temperatures of 70s to mid-80s. Lower ozone levels align with cooler temperatures. Overall, the scatter plot shows a clear trend of higher ozone levels being linked to warmer temperatures but with significant variability.

# Pivot Tables and Charts (Real Class Topic)

\##**Pivot Table Basics:**

1.  I Inserted a pivot table on a new sheet.
2.  Selected variables from the air quality dataset to input into rows and values.
3.  The professor explained the count, sum, and average options for data analysis.
4.  Finally, in class, we were asked to create our own version of a pivot table to understand, analyze, and interpret the data.

**Key Insights:** Higher temperatures and increased solar radiation are linked to higher ozone levels. As heat and sunlight rise, ozone levels generally increase, reflecting their strong correlation. Cooler temperatures and less sunlight lead to lower ozone concentrations, showing that both factors significantly influence ozone levels.

## **Work in class**

1.  today the professor wanted us to go back into the creation of pivot tables,but now we had to make charts from the pivot tables

2.  we kept on using on the same data set from from airquality and now we had to come up with as much as possible pivot table.

### **Pivot Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month**

1.  I did A "Comparative Analysis of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month" using a clustered column chart

### **Key Insights:**

**1. Temperature:** Highest in row 9 (2230) and lowest in row 6 (704), likely reflecting seasonal or geographic factors.

**2.Wind:** Highest wind speed in row 9 (292.2). Row 7 shows lower wind (221.6) despite high temperatures, suggesting terrain or local weather effects.

**3 Solar Radiation:** High solar radiation corresponds with high temperatures in rows 7 (5627) and 9 (4878). Lower radiation in row 8 (3981) could be due to cloud cover or atmospheric conditions.

**4. Ozone:** Ozone peaks in row 7 (1537), with no clear link to temperature, suggesting factors like pollution or altitude may influence levels.

**5.Wind:**Wind generally increases with temperature (row 9: 292.2), but in row 7, lower wind (221.6) despite high temperatures suggests local factors like terrain or weather conditions affecting wind patterns.

**6.Solar Radiation:**High solar radiation aligns with higher temperatures (row 7: 5627, row 9: 4878), though row 8’s lower radiation (3981) may be due to cloud cover or atmospheric conditions.

**7.Ozone:** Ozone peaks in row 7 (1537), but there’s no clear link to temperature, suggesting factors like pollution, altitude, or industrial activity might influence ozone levels.

### Pivot Table 2: Minimum Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month

**1.Solar Radiation**: The lowest solar radiation is in row 7 (7), indicating minimal sunlight exposure, possibly due to increased cloud cover, shorter daylight hours, or winter months. Row 6 (37) and row 8 (24) are higher, suggesting more sunlight in those periods.

**2.Temperature:**Row 5 has the lowest temperature (57), possibly reflecting a colder season or location. Row 7 (73) represents a slightly warmer period but still marks the minimum temperature in that context.

**3.Wind:** The lowest wind speed is found in row 8 (2.3), likely due to calm conditions, while row 6 (8) shows stronger winds, possibly due to more open areas or seasonal wind patterns.

**These findings point to cooler, calmer, and less sunny conditions in specific months or locations, affected by seasonal or environmental factors.**

### Pivot Table 3: Maximum Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month

**1. Solar Radiation:** The highest solar radiation is in row 5 (334), followed closely by row 6 (323). This suggests that these months or locations receive the most sunlight, likely due to clearer skies or longer daylight hours. Temperature:

**2.Temperature:** is in row 8 (97), reflecting a very warm period or location. Rows 7 (92) and 9 (93) also show high temperatures, indicating consistently hot conditions during these months. Wind:

**3.Wind:** is in row 6 (20.7), which may indicate exposure to more intense weather conditions or open areas. Row 5 (20.1) also shows similarly high wind levels, while other rows exhibit slightly lower values. These findings suggest that rows 5 and 6 experience peak solar radiation and wind, while row 8 stands out for its extreme temperature, reflecting the influence of seasonal or geographical factors on these maximum values.
