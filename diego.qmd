# US Department of Agriculture - Diego Mendoza

## Wednesday

### Overview

-Work on new data set based on previous skills -observe changes on different visual graphs -Explain any patterns or observe points -Test test and test again

### Attitude

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Attitude_Base.png)

\*\* Background Information \*\*

-   No context was given for the data set
-   7 columns: rating, complaint, privileges, leaning, raises, critical, advance
-   Rating attitude

### Filtering

(How to Follow) -Use Condition Formating (In Home) -Highlight cells, equalt too or less than (58.5)

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Attitude_Base1.png)

### Observations

-Each column has at least 2 cells =\<50
-Advance attitude perform poorly in an standard normal look(Bigger = Better) -Critical attitude excelling in an standard normal look(Bigger = Better) -

### Filtering + Formulas

(How to Follow) -Select group of Cells, Rows or Columns -Use Condition Formating (In Home) -Highlight cells, duplicate

-Select group of Cells, Rows or Columns -Select Formulas -Use Average, Ma, Min

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Attitude_Base2.png)

### Observations

-   11 unique values that do not overlap/duplicated in another cell
-   Highest value was Critical with 92, Complaint had the 2nd highest with 90, 
-\> However that value appears to an outliar

-Minimum belongs to advance with 25 with privilege 2nd lowest with 30.
-Critical with the highest average with 74.77 complaint 2nd highest with 66.59

### Graphs

(How to Follow) -Select group of Cells, Rows or Columns -In the setting insert, select graph or recommend graph

### Observations

-   Bar graphs and pie graphs are not ver useful and do not provide any sort of information or trends

-The scatter plot is useful seeing where the cluster is and having a visual provided of where those values are in relation to each other
-\>Trends Complaints and learning has a postie correlation in related to rating. The higher the rating the higher the complaint attitude

-Statics chart helpful in showing where the concentration of the overall data is.

-Best graph that represent the data was Scatter plot, 
-\>Easier to individual points and groups. 
-\>Can apply basic functions, or understanding to see trends 
-\> Overall seem that those with Combative attitudes excelled, those who were humble seemed to a had a positive trend and privileged posh attitudes performed worse than counterparts.

### Summary

-Applied skills learned from Monday -Found trends patterns and made conclusions -Researched possible data sets and other techniques

## Friday

### Overview

-Cleaning and filtering data in relation to soil samples
-Applying techniques learned from Monday and Wednesday to data set
-Document all necessary actions for repeatable research
-Find a story in the data


### Data Information

-Data is from the USDA
-Multiple different data sets that could be chosen
->Friday's focuses on solid yield from 1984 - 1993
-Specific data can be found pressing the link
[Data from Tillage and cropping effects on soil quality indicators in the northern Great Plains](https://agdatacommons.nal.usda.gov/articles/dataset/Data_from_Tillage_and_cropping_effects_on_soil_quality_indicators_in_the_northern_Great_Plains/26673769?file=48572716)

-The study provides insights into how soil properties respond to crop rotation and tillage practices under rainfed conditions in a semiarid continental climate

#### Column Name and Information
PLOT: Plot number, identifying the specific plot where the data was collected.
REP: Replicate number, indicating the repetition of the experiment or sampling within the plot.
ROTATION: Crop rotation system used in the experiment, typically represented by a code.
-TILLAGE: Tillage treatment, also represented by a code (e.g., T1, T2).
-DEPTH: Soil sampling depth (in cm).
-SBD: Soil bulk density (g/cmÂ³).
-EC: Electrical conductivity (dS/m), a measure of soil salinity.
-PH: Soil pH level.
-NO3N: Nitrate nitrogen (mg/kg), an indicator of soil nitrogen content.
-SOC: Soil organic carbon (mg/kg).
-TN: Total nitrogen (mg/kg).
-PMN: Potentially mineralizable nitrogen (mg/kg).
-POMLF: Particulate organic matter light fraction (mg/kg).
-POMSF: Particulate organic matter small fraction (mg/kg).
-POMT: Total particulate organic matter (mg/kg).
-POMSOM: Particulate organic matter as a percentage of soil organic matter.
-MBC: Microbial biomass carbon (mg/kg).
-MBN: Microbial biomass nitrogen (mg/kg)

### Intial Observation

(How to Follow) -Select group of Cells, Rows or Columns
-Select column with depth,(Step1)
-select all 7.5cm (Step2)
-shift arrow -> 4 rows (Step3)
-In the setting insert, select graph or recommend graph(Step4)
-For this we used a Column cluster(reccomended)

#### 7.5 cm depth

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil1.png) 


#### 15 cm depth

-Repeats steps, changing 7.5 to 15

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil2.png) 

#### 30 cm depth

-Repeats steps, changing 7.5 to 30

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil3.png) 


### observations

-On Graphs 2 & 3 seem to lacking a series 4 and both have high series 7
-On Graph 1 lacks series 5-7 and series 


### Focus + 2nd graph

-Focused on 2 columns ph and NO3N
->PH level and nitrogen.

-Highlighted each PH and NO3N for each respective depth
-Selected graphs for each a line graph

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil4.png)

#### Observations

-Depth seems to correlate to steadier levels in PH and N03N to 15cm
-15cm depth seems to the best to hold consistent level in PH and N03N
-7.5cm depth has the largest variance highest Max in NO3n
-30cm depth had the lowest valley in NO3N


### Formatting 

-Highlight cells rule, less than value (6.25)
-Highlighted each PH and NO3N for each respective depth

![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil5.png)
#### Observations

-30 + 15 cm depths' nitrogen is below 6.25 cm
-7.5cm depth's PH is below 6.25


### Summary

-Worked with team lead and Professor at data sets and possible ideas 
-Discussed what expectations were set and what documentation should look like 
-Worked on USDA data set
-Applied skills and tools to dataset

### Notes for next work
-Larger and more background information on a dataset is useful
-Lacked comparsion test to 1984 data set
-Extended research into subject provides a working platform
-Large data sets become complicated to work with and see at once on excel
