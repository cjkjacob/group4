I am using the airquality data set, which is has 6 columns.
**Columns**: Ozone,Solar.R,Wind,Temp,Month,Day
**Ozone**: Concentration of ozone in the atmosphere, measured in parts per billion (ppb).
**Solar.R**: Solar radiation in the atmosphere, measured in langleys (a unit of energy per unit area).
**Wind**: Wind speed, measured in miles per hour (mph).
**Temp**: Temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit (°F).
**Month**: Month of the year, represented as an integer (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
**Day**: Day of the month, represented as an integer.

**Location**: Recorded from **New York**

**Span**- May-September

##### Observations

The months observed are May, Jun, July, August, and September
Average Solar Radiation has an **Inverse Relationship** with Wind
Ozone has a **positive correlation** with Solar R

On closer day to day Ozone and Temp have identical trends
Ozone mimics radiation but on lower scale

**Inverse relationship between Solar Radiation and Wind:**
This could occur because higher solar radiation typically results in warmer, more stable air masses, which may reduce wind speed. Wind is often driven by differences in air pressure, and if the atmosphere becomes more uniform due to increased solar heating, wind speeds may drop. Also, high-pressure areas, which are associated with clear skies and stronger solar radiation, often have lighter winds compared to low-pressure areas.

**Positive correlation between Ozone and Solar Radiation:**
Ozone concentration in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) can increase with solar radiation, especially during the summer months. This is because ozone is formed through photochemical reactions involving sunlight and pollutants like nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Therefore, higher solar radiation provides the energy needed to drive these reactions, leading to higher ozone levels.

**Day-to-day identical trends between Ozone and Temperature:**
 Ozone levels often increase with higher temperatures. This is largely due to the fact that photochemical reactions leading to ozone formation are more active at higher temperatures. Additionally, on warmer days, there is typically more stagnant air, which can trap pollutants and increase ozone levels. Hence, the similar trends between temperature and ozone levels.

**Ozone mimicking Solar Radiation but on a smaller scale:**
The pattern here suggests that while solar radiation directly affects ozone formation, other factors such as pollution levels, temperature, and atmospheric mixing also play significant roles in determining actual ozone concentrations. So, while the trend is similar, the scale is smaller because ozone is dependent on several additional variables beyond solar radiation alone.

These relationships could reflect broader atmospheric and environmental patterns, particularly related to summer months when sunlight and temperature both peak, driving many of these processes.

#### Intro 1.0

USDA data set 
Focused data sets
Projection of Midterm Project


#### USDA 1.1

The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) is a federal agency responsible for overseeing agriculture, food safety, natural resources, rural development, and related areas in the United States. Founded in 1862, its primary mission is to support farmers, promote agricultural production, and ensure a safe and affordable food supply. The USDA works to improve the economy, provide food assistance programs, and protect the environment. It plays a key role in creating and implementing policies that impact farming, forestry, rural communities, and conservation efforts.

The USDA collects and records a wide range of data across various sectors, including crop production, livestock, economic and environmental statistics, and food security. They compile data on crop yields, prices, weather patterns, and soil quality, along with data related to rural development and economic conditions. In addition, the USDA monitors food safety and nutrition, conducting surveys on food consumption, food assistance programs, and the nutritional health of Americans. They also record information on natural resource usage and conservation efforts, aiming to promote sustainable agricultural practices.

This data is used for several purposes. It helps guide policy decisions related to agriculture and food security, ensuring that food production remains stable and resilient. The data supports research, informs farmers and agribusinesses about market trends and conditions, and helps policymakers create programs that improve rural communities and the environment. Additionally, USDA data informs trade negotiations and decisions on subsidies or tariffs for agricultural products. On a broader scale, the data is used to track climate change's effects on agriculture and promote practices that can mitigate these effects.

##### Overview of Research

The research on tillage and cropping effects on soil quality indicators in the northern Great Plains highlights the significant role of cropping systems in enhancing soil health. Various studies indicate that diverse cropping practices, particularly those incorporating cover crops and reduced tillage, can lead to improved soil quality metrics.

**Impact of Crop Diversity**
Increased crop diversity, such as incorporating cover crops, enhances soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) compared to monoculture systems(Feng et al., 2020).
Crop rotation systems have shown to improve soil aggregate stability and enzyme activity, which are crucial for nutrient cycling(Feng et al., 2020).
**Tillage Practices**
No-till practices have been associated with higher SOC and improved soil structure, particularly in the topsoil(Fiorini et al., 2020)(Liebig et al., 2004).
Long-term studies indicate that continuous cropping with no-till significantly enhances soil nutrient availability and reduces erosion risks(Liebig et al., 2004).
**Microbial Community Dynamics**
The composition and diversity of soil bacterial communities are influenced more by cropping systems than by crop identity, suggesting that management practices are critical for soil health(Ouverson et al., 2021).
While these findings underscore the benefits of diverse cropping systems and reduced tillage, it is essential to consider that not all practices yield uniform results across different soil types and climatic conditions, indicating a need for tailored approaches in agricultural management.


#### Objectives

##### Main objective
Assess the impact of tillage practices: Compare soil properties (e.g., bulk density, organic matter, pH) across different tillage systems (e.g., T1, T2) to determine how tillage affects soil health and suitability for agriculture.

##### Other possible research points
Analyze crop rotation effects: Evaluate how different crop rotation practices impact soil fertility and microbial biomass by analyzing nitrogen levels, organic carbon, and other key metrics.

Examine soil depth influence: Investigate how soil properties change with depth (e.g., 7.5 cm) and assess whether deeper soil layers are more or less fertile.

Track year-by-year changes: Observe trends in soil health and fertility over time by analyzing patterns in the dataset based on yearly measurements, if time-based data is included.

Microbial biomass and soil fertility: Investigate how microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) relates to soil fertility across different management practices.

Particulate organic matter (POM) impact: Explore the role of particulate organic matter in contributing to overall soil organic matter (POMSOM) and its effect on agricultural productivity.

Correlation between EC, pH, and nutrient availability: Study how soil electrical conductivity (EC) and pH affect the availability of key nutrients like nitrate nitrogen (NO3N), organic carbon, and total nitrogen.

#### Summary

The USDA supports agriculture, food safety, rural development, and environmental protection in the U.S., collecting data on crop production, soil quality, and food security to inform policy and guide farmers. Research from fields in North Dakota focuses on the effects of tillage and crop rotation on soil health, highlighting the benefits of reduced tillage and crop diversity. The data evaluates key soil properties like bulk density, organic carbon, and microbial biomass to assess the impact of these agricultural practices. The goal is to promote sustainable farming by understanding how different management systems affect soil quality and productivity over time.
