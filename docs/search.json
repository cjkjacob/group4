    "text": "2.1.1 Wednesday\n\n2.1.1.1 Recap and Quarto Document Guidance\nActivity: The class began with a more in-depth explanation of Quarto documents for those unfamiliar with the process.\nTopics Covered:\n1.Naming and building Quarto notes.\n2.Professor V. used a student example to create a small Excel sheet based on the student’s daily food intake and corresponding calorie count.\n3.He built a graph of the food items and their calorie counts, then demonstrated how to insert the graph into a Quarto document.\n4.Provided guidance on how to log the information effectively within Quarto to meet his expectations.\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Practical Application: Excel Data Visualization\nActivity: Continued from Monday’s class.\n1.Task: Repeated the data cleaning and visualization process with a different dataset.\n2.Dataset Used: Economics dataset.\n3.Data Preparation: - Checked for NA values or empty cells (none were found). - Sorted the data in ascending order based on date values. - Focused on the relationship between psavert (personal savings rate) and uempmed (median duration of unemployment).\n\n\n2.1.1.3 Data Visualization Process\n1.Graphs Created: I Created a line , bar graphs and scatter plot, to find which ne was the easiest to interpreted to explore the relationship between psavert and uempmed from different perspectives.\n2.Final Choice: I selected scatter plot graph, the line bar graph i found it unclear how to interpret the scatter plot provided a clearer and easier-to-read visualization of the data.\n3.Additional Observations:\nThere are a few points where the personal saving rate is relatively low. This might indicate special circumstances or different economic conditions during those periods. The two variables don’t seem to have a strong linear relationship. The points are fairly scattered, indicating that changes in the personal saving rate don’t consistently correlate with changes in the median duration of unemployment.\n\n\n2.1.1.4 Key Takeaways from Professor V.\nUnderstanding Context:\n\nIt’s crucial to understand the context of your dataset before deciding on the type of visualization.\nOnce the dataset is understood, choose visualizations that effectively compare relationships between columns (e.g., petal length vs. petal width in another example; in this case, psavert vs. uempmed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Friday\n\n2.1.2.1 Class Activity\nToday, we worked in class with our groups, focusing on our individual datasets. I chose to work with NASA Earth Data, a resource I’ll be utilizing throughout the semester.\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Dataset Exploration\nI began by exploring the NASA Earth Data portal, which offers a broad range of datasets across various topics like the atmosphere, earth quality, biosphere, human dimensions, and sun-earth interactions. Each main topic is further divided into subtopics, where users can download data in formats like CSV and Excel.\nThe portal also features a “Learn” section that provides tutorials and guides on how to read and use the data particularly useful for those new to the platform.\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Dataset Selection\nI was particularly interested in the “Human Dimensions” topic, which explores how humans interact with Earth’s resources. After filtering the available datasets by format (CSV and Excel) and sorting by the oldest end date, I selected the dataset titled Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production from SRES Emissions and Socioeconomic Scenarios.\nThis dataset caught my attention because global food production has always been of interest to me, especially considering the drastic changes in soil quality and agricultural methods over the years. Additionally, the way human activities have affected the soil and food production varies significantly by country.\n\n\n2.1.2.4 Dataset Overview\nClimate Change and Global Food Production\nSummary:\nThe agricultural sector is facing significant challenges due to population growth, land degradation, and urbanization, all of which threaten global food production. Climate change is expected to intensiy these challenges, particularly in regions vulnerable to drought and famine.\nA NASA study used crop modeling to assess the impacts of climate change on food production. The study emphasizes that water availability and temperature are critical factors affecting crop yields. It also considers the effects of CO2 and suggests that climate change could have a significant impact on global food production, prices, and the risk of hunger.\n\n\n2.1.2.5 Data Analysis\n\nI downloaded the dataset and opened it in Excel to begin the data cleaning process. The dataset covers average crop production for various countries from 2000-2006. For this analysis, I focused on the variables: country code, wheat, rice, maize, and added a new variable for the year. I first calculated the mean, maximum, and minimum production values for each country for wheat, rice, and maize. China had the highest production values across all three variables—wheat, rice, and maize. On the other hand, Venezuela had the lowest production for wheat, Saudi Arabia for rice, and Japan for maize. To visualize this, I created a 100% stacked column chart. The graph shows that maize is the most produced crop across all countries, while wheat and rice exhibit irregular consistency over the years from 2000 to 2006. \nNext, I created a pie chart to confirm my hypothesis. The chart reveals that maize has the highest average production among the three crops, suggesting it might be more widely cultivated or more important in global agriculture compared to wheat and rice. Rice also has a relatively high average production, indicating its global importance as a staple food. Wheat, despite having the lowest average production among the three, still shows a substantial amount.\n. Additionally, I created another stacked column chart to view the crop production across all 74 countries. This broader analysis revealed that China has the highest production numbers, while Switzerland has the lowest. I calculated the average production for each crop for each country and determined the maximum and minimum average production across the three crops for each country. The results show Switzerland with the lowest average production overall, and India with the second highest average production, as reflected in the graph.\nIn the scatter plot, I observed a strong relationship between the production of wheat and rice. China and India were identified as clear outliers with extremely high production values for all crops. This plot helps in visualizing the tendencies and relationships between the production levels of different crops across countries.\nThen created a line graph to analyze production trends over time. Although China and India have the highest production points, the chart reveals a lack of consistency in their production levels. In contrast, wheat and maize, while showing lower production values, exhibit more consistent levels across countries. Nations with consistently low production lines may face agricultural challenges or have less focus on these crops.\n\n\n\n2.1.2.6 Summarize insights\n\nChina (CHN) leads in production with the highest values across all crops—wheat, rice, and maize—showing significant output in each category.\nSwitzerland (SW) exhibits the lowest production values across all crops, indicating minimal agricultural output.\nChina has the highest average production per country, reflecting its extensive agricultural operations and capacity.\nCountries with low average production, such as Switzerland and Swaziland, highlight their limited agricultural activities and output.\nMaize has the highest maximum production values across several countries, underscoring its significant role in global agriculture.\nRice shows high production values in several countries, including China and India, emphasizing its importance as a staple food.\nWheat production is relatively high in several countries but is not as dominant as maize or rice.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Cleaning the dataset\nBefore processing and creating visualizations of the dataset, it is important to prep the dataset by cleaning it. There might be N/A values or outliers in the dataset, which needs to be removed and cleaned to create better and more accurate visualizations.\nTo clean the data, there are a few things that can be done: - Finding and highlighting NA values by selecting the range of cells and doing ‘Conditional Formatting’ to ‘Highlight Cells Rules’. - Removing NA values by using the ‘Find and Replace’. Find ‘NA’ and replace it with ‘0’. - Using IF function to check for NA values and replace it accordingly. Ex: =IF(A2=“NA”, “0”, A2)\nAdditionally, upon converting the Swiss dataset from a .csv format into an Excel, the first column of the dataset became combined into one cell.\n\nI fixed the titles that are separated by commas in the one cell by separating the titles into the different respective columns.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Context of dataset\nBefore creating plots and visualizations of the dataset, it is important to know what each title in the columns mead and understand the context of the dataset.\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/swiss.html\nThe dataset contains 47 French-speaking “provinces” in Switzerland at around 1888. During that year, Switzerland was entering a demographic transition, where its fertility rates was beginning to fall from the typical level of underdeveloped countries. There are 6 variables in the dataset, where variables are scaled from 0 to 100, except Cathloic that is scaled from 0 to 1. The definitions of the dataset are as below:\n\nFertility = common standardized fertility measure\nAgriculture = % of males involved in agriculture as occupation\nExamination = % draftees receiving highest mark on army examination\nEducation = % education beyond primary school for draftees.\nCatholic = % ‘catholic’ (as opposed to ‘protestant’).\nInfant.Mortality = live births who live less than 1 year.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Creating Different Basic Visualizations\n\n3.1.3.1 Scatterplot 1 - Fertility and Cathlic appear to cluster in two groups with four outliers\nIn creating plots, I utilized Excel’s tool of Recommended Charts, which included a scatterplot of ‘Fertility’ and ‘Catholic’. The scatterplot shown below shows two groups of cluster with four outliers.\n\nAs shown in the scatterplot, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic people seem to have a slightly higher fertility compared to provinces with low percentage of Catholic people.\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Scatterplot 2 - Relationship between infant mortality and percentage of Catholic people in a province\n Based on the scatterplot above, infant mortality and Catholic appear to have no apparent relationship. However, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic population appear to has a slightly higher infant mortality, with a few provinces having 25 and more live births in a year. Meanwhile, the provinces with a low percentage of Catholic population appear to have infant mortality mostly in the 15-25 range.\nAside from that, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population or a very low percentage of Catholic population, with the scatterplot showing two clusters on the lower end of Catholic percentage (0-20%) and a higher end of Catholic percentage (80-100%). What do you observe?\n\n\n3.1.3.3 Bar Charts\n As mentioned in the discussion above, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population, or a very low percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart shows a high frequency within the 2.15-7.15% of Catholic population that gradually decreases as the percentage approaches 17.15-22.15 and gradually increases again as it approaches the 87.15-92.15 percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart above better visualize the two groups of highly populated Catholic province or lowly populated Catholic province.\n\n\n3.1.3.4 Line Chart\n The line chart above clearly shows that there is a direct relationship between examination and education. As the percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees increases, the percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination also increases. The two variables showcase a positive directly correlated relationship. Aside from that, the graph also shows that the 46th province outperformed all of the other provinces with the highest percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees and also the highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination. The 46th province is followed by the 42th province which has the second highest percentage of education beyond primary school and second highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination.\n\n\n3.1.3.5 Pie Charts\n The pie chart does not really visualize the agriculture data well, as there are too many percentage classification of males involved in agriculture occupation. However, the pie chart can be made better by making the classifications into 5 groups to see which range of percentage of males involved in agriculture occupation is higher among the other provinces.\n\n\n3.1.3.6 Histograms\n The histogram shows a slightly negative skew on the frequency of males involved in agriculture as occupation. The majority of the provinces have males involved in agriculture on the 61.2-71.2% range. The 1.2-11.2% range and the 21.2-31.2% range of males involved in agriculture have the lowest frequency.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 What plot represent better the data? why?\nThere isn’t any plot that is more superior that the other, but it wholly depends on the variables being plotted. For instance, the relationship between examination and education can be better represented using a line chart, as a line chart shows a more visible distinction between the variable of examination and education. If using a scatterplot, the many plots in the chart may cause the distinction between the two variables to be less visible, as the two variables are directly correlated and have values very closely to one another.\nOn the other hand, using a scatterplot can better highlight the two groups of highly-populated Catholic provinces and lowly-populated Catholic provinces better than a barchart. The scatterplot can visualize the two groups of clusters on opposite ends, highlighting there there are two major groups in the Swiss: Catholic heavily-populated province or Protestant heavily-populated province\nTherefore,different plots have different uses and can highlight the relationship of some variables better than the other, depending on the context and relationship of the variables being plotted. It is important to explore the different relationships of variables using different charts and plots to better visualize the relationships of the variables in the dataset.",

    "section": "3.2 Friday",
    "text": "3.2 Friday\n\n3.2.1 Choosing the source and dataset\n\nThe source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/.\n\nI chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different datasets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.\n\nFor this assignment, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm on which dataset I should choose from and why.\n\nAfter using ChatGPT and exploring the source website some more, I decided to choose the dataset containing Corporate Profits by Industry with this link: https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/6257. I downloaded the whole data lists, as it all involves the relevant corporate profits of different industries and sub-sectors.\n\n\nI think that it would be interesting to visualize how the different industries’ profits vary throughout the years, and whether there are correlations between any industries. I downloaded the dataset as Excel format.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Context of the dataset\nThe dataset contains quarterly data on the corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment for different industries, including non-financial, financial, federal, and many other sub-categories such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and utilities. The data is presented in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted annual rate. To set parameter, the study for this assignment only looks at the 10 year span from first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\n3.2.3 Cleaning and organizing the dataset\n\nReplacing Series ID with Titles\n\nThe dataset contains columns with Series ID instead of titles. Therefore, it needs to be replaced with the titles, which can be viewed in the other sheet in the same Excel document. - To do this, I copied the first Series ID and paste it on the ‘Find’ tool.\n\n\nThen, I go to the other sheet in the same Excel document to find the same Series ID and locate the title\n\n\n\nAfter locating the title, I copied it and paste it on the dataset sheet to replace the Series ID with the right title.\n\n\n\nRepeat this until all other Series ID are replaced with its title\n\n\nMaking the titles more concise When copy and pasting back the titles to the dataset sheet, I realized that the titles are very long and repetitive. Therefore, I reorganized the title and make it shorter and more concise.\nFormatting the columns to be more organized and neat To do this, I expanded the columns to the right width, and centered the text. Additionally, I also deleted the rows with data outside of the 10 year span from 2014 to 2024, as it is outside the parameter of the this exploration.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Making Visualizations\nIn making visualizations, I utilized Excel’s ‘Recommended Charts’ tool under ‘Insert’. After using the tool, I looked over the data and explore to create more meaningful visualizations on my own.\n\n3.2.4.1 Line chart: Average Total Profits in 10 Years\n\nWhen I added a graph from the ‘Recommended Charts’, a new sheet is created along with corporate profits summed into yearly instead of quarterly.\n\n\nTotal corporate profits increase over the 10 year period.\nThere are some significant declines in corporate profits The two major declines occurred in the span of end of quarter of 2019 to end of quarter of 2020. in the late quarter of 2019 to 2020. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the sudden drop in corporate profits, with the lock-down, inflation, and slowdown of the economy. The economy healed in the first two quarters of 2020 as the lock-downs are alleviated, however declined again in the end of quarter of 2020.\nThe private enterprises’ profits appear to be very steadily increasing from first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2024. The total corporate profits appear to be higher than the average total corporate profits dotted line, signifying that the increase in total corporate profits are quite significant.\n\n\n\n3.2.4.2 Scatterplot 1: Domestic Industries (Non-financial: Manufacturing) vs. Federal\n\n\n“Domestic Industries: Non-financial: Manufacturing” appears to have an inverse relationship with “Federal”\n\nAs ‘Manufacturing’ is high at a range of 675-825 billion dollars, ‘Federal’ appears to be on hundreds of billion dollars loss. However, as ‘Manufacturing’ decreases to below 600 billion dollars, ‘Federal’s’ corporate profits improved to a range of 50-125 billion dollars.\n\n\n3.2.4.3 Scatterplot 2: Wholesale trade vs. Transportation and warehousing\n\n\nAs wholesale trade’s corporate profits increases, the corporate profits in the sub-sector of transportation and warehousing also increases.\n\nThe direct and proportional relationship of the two sub-sectors make sense, as wholesale trade involves purchasing goods in large quantities and reselling them in smaller quantities to businesses and other wholesalers, directly involving transportation and warehousing of the goods.\n\n\n3.2.4.4 Barchart: Non-financial vs. Financial Domestic Industry\n\n\nThe non-financial domestic industry’s corporate profits are growing more significantly compared to the financial domestic industry’s stable corporate profits\n\nThe non-financial domestic industry are growing more rapidly, especially in the last half of the decade. The financial domestic industry has over 2500 billions of dollars of corporate profits in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, the financial domestic industry appears to have stable corporate profits throughout the past 10 years, as its corporate profits are varying slightly from year to year and are stuck under 750 billion dollars.\n\n\n3.2.4.5 Piechart: Non-financial makes up the majority of the domestic industry’s corporate profits\n\n\nNon-financial domestic industry takes 70% of the domestic industry’s corporate profits, while the rest of the world takes up only 14% of the domestic industry’s corporate profits.\nAs stated in a study, non-financial corporations are responsible for a large share of the economic activity in most advanced economies (Tebrake & O’hagan, n.d.), which maakes sense as a lot of the important sub-sectors belong to the non-financial industry (including manufacturing of durable and non-durable goods, wholesale trade, retail trade, utilities, and information)\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 References\n\nTebrake, J., & O’hagan, P.

    "text": "4.1.1 Diamonds Dataset\nI applied the learnings and findings from the Excel Unit to another dataset, the diamonds_ggplot2.csv set. -  - The Diamonds dataset defines the different characteristics of a diamond namely, carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, price, and lengths in the x, y, and z direction The dataset itself did not have any NA values, and hence did not need any additional steps for cleaning the data. An interesting observation to be made was that there are several interesting correlations between the columns that can help us observe some basic trends in the diamond trading business. There were more than 53,000 records collected, and so this dataset is very comprehensive!\n\n4.1.1.1 Preparing the dataset\nConsidering the size of the dataset, I had to use 500 random records to create my visualizations. Here’s a step by step guide on how I did that.\n\n4.1.1.1.1 Add a random number column\n\nChoose a column and add the RAND() function to the column. Double click on the bottom right of the cell to paste the function to the rest of the rows in the dataset. This creates a random number between 0 and 1. \nNext, we apply a filter to the entire dataset, and use the random number column (sorting it from smallest to largest). This automatically rearranges the data records, making the first 500 random. \nCopy the first 500 records to a new sheet. This now becomes your 500 records that give you a true random overview of the Diamonds dataset. \nSince the records didn’t contain any NA values, this looked like the only preparation I needed to do.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.1.2 Creating visualizations\n\n4.1.1.1.2.1 Scatter Plot: Carat VS Price\n\nThe first plot I created was a scatter plot that visualized the relationship between the carat of the diamond and the price it would sell at \nFrom this, we can see that the dimaonds that have a higher carat sell for more.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.1.2.2 Histogram: Sum of Price by Color\n\nThe next plot I created was a histogram that visualized the relationship between the prices and the color of the diamond. \nFrom this chart, it was clear to see that the diamonds that had the most value were those with the ‘H’ coloration.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.1.2.3 Other charts\n\nWhen trying to create more visualizations, I observed that not all charts were capable of visualizing this data, and furthermore, given the size of the dataset, all operations were much slower on the online excel sheet.\nI believe the best visualization for such data is the Scatter Plot of Price vs Carats, because it captures the inherent reality that more carats means more price. All in all, it was an interesting start to the class and helped me better understand how visualizations can be achieved on excel.",

    "text": "4.2 Friday\n\n4.2.1 NCES Education Dataset\nNCES Education Dataset is extremely vast and includes several different studies conducted over a range of years. Today, we’ll only be focusing the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/index.asp\nThe High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) is a comprehensive study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It tracks a cohort of students who began 9th grade in 2009, following them through their high school years and beyond into postsecondary education and the workforce. The study focuses on students’ educational trajectories, especially in STEM, examining factors like course-taking patterns, college aspirations, and career choices. The data collected provides insights into how high school experiences influence long-term educational and career outcomes.\n\n4.2.1.1 Working with the datset\n\nThis can be an extremely complicated process. The first step should be to go to https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/membership/register and registering yourself to access all the benefits that NCES datalabs offer. \nThis gives us access to the data lab dashboard. Since we can’t use excel because of the extremely large size, so we’ll have to use the datalabs power stats tool for this. \n\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Simple Visualization\n\nConsidering that I couldn’t use excel for this process, it was interesting to see the amount of data and variables I had at my disposal for this project. For example, just the keyword ‘STEM’ has 294 variables attached to it.\nOne comparison I made using the PowerStats tool to create a percentage analysis of the relationship between variables S1 and S3.\n\nS1 looks into how math teachers make math so easy to understand. This is divided as ‘Strongly Agree’, ‘Agree’, ‘Neutral’, ‘Disagree’, ‘Strongly Disagree’\nS3 shows how students might consider STEM as a major.\n\nThis visualization further strengthens the premise that teachers are the defining factors in a lot of the future decisions that students make.\n\n\n\n\nPecentage Analysis\n\n\n\nIt further allowed me to use the bar chart to show this information visually. \n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Inference\n\nThese visualizations make it clear that teachers who help make concepts like math and science easier to understand, help these students choose STEM as a major in university.\nThis insight will further add to the ‘STEM Focused’ dataset that I’ll be building during this semester.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Conclusion\n\nGiven the vastness of this dataset, I believe it’s important for me to better understand and comprehend this dataset, so that I can fully utilize and appreciate all the data collected. Although I wasn’t able to use Excel on this dataset, the skills learned in the previous classes definitely helped set me up for success with this.",
