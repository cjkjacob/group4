Wind is often driven by differences in air pressure, and if the atmosphere becomes more uniform due to increased solar heating, wind speeds may drop. Also, high-pressure areas, which are associated with clear skies and stronger solar radiation, often have lighter winds compared to low-pressure areas.\nPositive correlation between Ozone and Solar Radiation: Ozone concentration in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) can increase with solar radiation, especially during the summer months. This is because ozone is formed through photochemical reactions involving sunlight and pollutants like nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Therefore, higher solar radiation provides the energy needed to drive these reactions, leading to higher ozone levels.\nDay-to-day identical trends between Ozone and Temperature: Ozone levels often increase with higher temperatures. This is largely due to the fact that photochemical reactions leading to ozone formation are more active at higher temperatures. Additionally, on warmer days, there is typically more stagnant air, which can trap pollutants and increase ozone levels. Hence, the similar trends between temperature and ozone levels.\nOzone mimicking Solar Radiation but on a smaller scale: The pattern here suggests that while solar radiation directly affects ozone formation, other factors such as pollution levels, temperature, and atmospheric mixing also play significant roles in determining actual ozone concentrations. So, while the trend is similar, the scale is smaller because ozone is dependent on several additional variables beyond solar radiation alone.\nThese relationships could reflect broader atmospheric and environmental patterns, particularly related to summer months when sunlight and temperature both peak, driving many of these processes.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Friday\n\n1.2.2.1 Intro 1.0\nUSDA data set Focused data sets Projection of Midterm Project\n\n\n1.2.2.2 USDA 1.1\nThe USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) is a federal agency responsible for overseeing agriculture, food safety, natural resources, rural development, and related areas in the United States. Founded in 1862, its primary mission is to support farmers, promote agricultural production, and ensure a safe and affordable food supply. The USDA works to improve the economy, provide food assistance programs, and protect the environment. It plays a key role in creating and implementing policies that impact farming, forestry, rural communities, and conservation efforts.\nThe USDA collects and records a wide range of data across various sectors, including crop production, livestock, economic and environmental statistics, and food security. They compile data on crop yields, prices, weather patterns, and soil quality, along with data related to rural development and economic conditions. In addition, the USDA monitors food safety and nutrition, conducting surveys on food consumption, food assistance programs, and the nutritional health of Americans. They also record information on natural resource usage and conservation efforts, aiming to promote sustainable agricultural practices.\nThis data is used for several purposes. It helps guide policy decisions related to agriculture and food security, ensuring that food production remains stable and resilient. The data supports research, informs farmers and agribusinesses about market trends and conditions, and helps policymakers create programs that improve rural communities and the environment. Additionally, USDA data informs trade negotiations and decisions on subsidies or tariffs for agricultural products. On a broader scale, the data is used to track climate change’s effects on agriculture and promote practices that can mitigate these effects.\n\n\n1.2.2.3 Focused Data set\nGeographic location - description Fields H1, H4, and H5 on the Area IV Soil Conservation Districts Cooperative Research Farm near Mandan, North Dakota USA. Fields H1 and H5 align with the 1984 experiment, while field H4 aligns with the 1993 experiment. *ISO Topic Category environment farming Ag Data Commons Group Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Northern Plains National Agricultural Library Thesaurus terms tillage; soil quality; Great Plains region; long term experiments; cropping sequence; soil conservation; cooperative research; farms; North Dakota; spring; grazing intensity; pastures; soil types; soil sampling; soil density; electrical conductivity; soil pH; nitrate nitrogen; soil organic carbon; nitrogen; particulate organic matter; microbial carbon; infiltration rate; stover; biomass production; laboratory techniques; combustion; crop rotation; continental climates\n\n1.2.2.3.1 Overview of Research\nThe research on tillage and cropping effects on soil quality indicators in the northern Great Plains highlights the significant role of cropping systems in enhancing soil health. Various studies indicate that diverse cropping practices, particularly those incorporating cover crops and reduced tillage, can lead to improved soil quality metrics.\nImpact of Crop Diversity Increased crop diversity, such as incorporating cover crops, enhances soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) compared to monoculture systems(Feng et al., 2020). Crop rotation systems have shown to improve soil aggregate stability and enzyme activity, which are crucial for nutrient cycling(Feng et al., 2020). Tillage Practices No-till practices have been associated with higher SOC and improved soil structure, particularly in the topsoil(Fiorini et al., 2020)(Liebig et al., 2004). Long-term studies indicate that continuous cropping with no-till significantly enhances soil nutrient availability and reduces erosion risks(Liebig et al., 2004). Microbial Community Dynamics The composition and diversity of soil bacterial communities are influenced more by cropping systems than by crop identity, suggesting that management practices are critical for soil health(Ouverson et al., 2021). While these findings underscore the benefits of diverse cropping systems and reduced tillage, it is essential to consider that not all practices yield uniform results across different soil types and climatic conditions, indicating a need for tailored approaches in agricultural management.\n\n\n\n1.2.2.4 Objectives\n\n1.2.2.4.1 Main objective\nAssess the impact of tillage practices: Compare soil properties (e.g., bulk density, organic matter, pH) across different tillage systems (e.g., T1, T2) to determine how tillage affects soil health and suitability for agriculture.\n\n\n1.2.2.4.2 Other possible research points\nAnalyze crop rotation effects: Evaluate how different crop rotation practices impact soil fertility and microbial biomass by analyzing nitrogen levels, organic carbon, and other key metrics.\nExamine soil depth influence: Investigate how soil properties change with depth (e.g., 7.5 cm) and assess whether deeper soil layers are more or less fertile.\nTrack year-by-year changes: Observe trends in soil health and fertility over time by analyzing patterns in the dataset based on yearly measurements, if time-based data is included.\nMicrobial biomass and soil fertility: Investigate how microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) relates to soil fertility across different management practices.\nParticulate organic matter (POM) impact: Explore the role of particulate organic matter in contributing to overall soil organic matter (POMSOM) and its effect on agricultural productivity.\nCorrelation between EC, pH, and nutrient availability: Study how soil electrical conductivity (EC) and pH affect the availability of key nutrients like nitrate nitrogen (NO3N), organic carbon, and total nitrogen.\n\n\n\n1.2.2.5 Summary\nThe USDA supports agriculture, food safety, rural development, and environmental protection in the U.S., collecting data on crop production, soil quality, and food security to inform policy and guide farmers. Research from fields in North Dakota focuses on the effects of tillage and crop rotation on soil health, highlighting the benefits of reduced tillage and crop diversity. The data evaluates key soil properties like bulk density, organic carbon, and microbial biomass to assess the impact of these agricultural practices. The goal is to promote sustainable farming by understanding how different management systems affect soil quality and productivity over time.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Wednesday\n\n2.1.1.1 Recap and Quarto Document Guidance\nActivity: The class began with a more in-depth explanation of Quarto documents for those unfamiliar with the process.\nTopics Covered:\n1.Naming and building Quarto notes.\n2.Professor V. used a student example to create a small Excel sheet based on the student’s daily food intake and corresponding calorie count.\n3.He built a graph of the food items and their calorie counts, then demonstrated how to insert the graph into a Quarto document.\n4.Provided guidance on how to log the information effectively within Quarto to meet his expectations.\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Practical Application: Excel Data Visualization\nActivity: Continued from Monday’s class.\n1.Task: Repeated the data cleaning and visualization process with a different dataset.\n2.Dataset Used: Economics dataset.\n3.Data Preparation: - Checked for NA values or empty cells (none were found). - Sorted the data in ascending order based on date values. - Focused on the relationship between psavert (personal savings rate) and uempmed (median duration of unemployment).\n\n\n2.1.1.3 Data Visualization Process\n1.Graphs Created: I Created a line , bar graphs and scatter plot, to find which ne was the easiest to interpreted to explore the relationship between psavert and uempmed from different perspectives.\n2.Final Choice: I selected scatter plot graph, the line bar graph i found it unclear how to interpret the scatter plot provided a clearer and easier-to-read visualization of the data.\n3.Additional Observations:\nThere are a few points where the personal saving rate is relatively low. This might indicate special circumstances or different economic conditions during those periods. The two variables don’t seem to have a strong linear relationship. The points are fairly scattered, indicating that changes in the personal saving rate don’t consistently correlate with changes in the median duration of unemployment.\n\n\n2.1.1.4 Key Takeaways from Professor V.\nUnderstanding Context:\n\nIt’s crucial to understand the context of your dataset before deciding on the type of visualization.\nOnce the dataset is understood, choose visualizations that effectively compare relationships between columns (e.g., petal length vs. petal width in another example; in this case, psavert vs. uempmed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Friday\n\n2.1.2.1 Class Activity\nToday, we worked in class with our groups, focusing on our individual datasets. I chose to work with NASA Earth Data, a resource I’ll be utilizing throughout the semester.\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Dataset Exploration\nI began by exploring the NASA Earth Data portal, which offers a broad range of datasets across various topics like the atmosphere, earth quality, biosphere, human dimensions, and sun-earth interactions. Each main topic is further divided into subtopics, where users can download data in formats like CSV and Excel.\nThe portal also features a “Learn” section that provides tutorials and guides on how to read and use the data particularly useful for those new to the platform.\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Dataset Selection\nI was particularly interested in the “Human Dimensions” topic, which explores how humans interact with Earth’s resources. After filtering the available datasets by format (CSV and Excel) and sorting by the oldest end date, I selected the dataset titled Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production from SRES Emissions and Socioeconomic Scenarios.\nThis dataset caught my attention because global food production has always been of interest to me, especially considering the drastic changes in soil quality and agricultural methods over the years. Additionally, the way human activities have affected the soil and food production varies significantly by country.\n\n\n2.1.2.4 Dataset Overview\nClimate Change and Global Food Production\nSummary:\nThe agricultural sector is facing significant challenges due to population growth, land degradation, and urbanization, all of which threaten global food production. Climate change is expected to intensiy these challenges, particularly in regions vulnerable to drought and famine.\nA NASA study used crop modeling to assess the impacts of climate change on food production. The study emphasizes that water availability and temperature are critical factors affecting crop yields. It also considers the effects of CO2 and suggests that climate change could have a significant impact on global food production, prices, and the risk of hunger.\n\n\n2.1.2.5 Data Analysis\n\nI downloaded the dataset and opened it in Excel to begin the data cleaning process. The dataset covers average crop production for various countries from 2000-2006. For this analysis, I focused on the variables: country code, wheat, rice, maize, and added a new variable for the year. I first calculated the mean, maximum, and minimum production values for each country for wheat, rice, and maize. China had the highest production values across all three variables—wheat, rice, and maize. On the other hand, Venezuela had the lowest production for wheat, Saudi Arabia for rice, and Japan for maize. To visualize this, I created a 100% stacked column chart. The graph shows that maize is the most produced crop across all countries, while wheat and rice exhibit irregular consistency over the years from 2000 to 2006. \nNext, I created a pie chart to confirm my hypothesis. The chart reveals that maize has the highest average production among the three crops, suggesting it might be more widely cultivated or more important in global agriculture compared to wheat and rice. Rice also has a relatively high average production, indicating its global importance as a staple food. Wheat, despite having the lowest average production among the three, still shows a substantial amount.\n. Additionally, I created another stacked column chart to view the crop production across all 74 countries. This broader analysis revealed that China has the highest production numbers, while Switzerland has the lowest. I calculated the average production for each crop for each country and determined the maximum and minimum average production across the three crops for each country. The results show Switzerland with the lowest average production overall, and India with the second highest average production, as reflected in the graph.\nIn the scatter plot, I observed a strong relationship between the production of wheat and rice. China and India were identified as clear outliers with extremely high production values for all crops. This plot helps in visualizing the tendencies and relationships between the production levels of different crops across countries.\nThen created a line graph to analyze production trends over time. Although China and India have the highest production points, the chart reveals a lack of consistency in their production levels. In contrast, wheat and maize, while showing lower production values, exhibit more consistent levels across countries. Nations with consistently low production lines may face agricultural challenges or have less focus on these crops.\n\n\n\n2.1.2.6 Summarize insights\n\nChina (CHN) leads in production with the highest values across all crops—wheat, rice, and maize—showing significant output in each category.\nSwitzerland (SW) exhibits the lowest production values across all crops, indicating minimal agricultural output.\nChina has the highest average production per country, reflecting its extensive agricultural operations and capacity.\nCountries with low average production, such as Switzerland and Swaziland, highlight their limited agricultural activities and output.\nMaize has the highest maximum production values across several countries, underscoring its significant role in global agriculture.\nRice shows high production values in several countries, including China and India, emphasizing its importance as a staple food.\nWheat production is relatively high in several countries but is not as dominant as maize or rice.",

The data helps analyze the relationship between these variables and environmental factors.\n\n\n2.2.1.1.2 Variables\n\nOzone (ppb): Measured between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM at Roosevelt Island.\nSolar.R (Langleys): Solar radiation measured from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM at Central Park.\nWind (mph): Average wind speed at LaGuardia Airport, recorded between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM.\nTemp (°F): Maximum daily temperature at LaGuardia Airport.\nMonth: Numeric (1 = May, 9 = September).\nDay: Day of the month.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.1.3 Source\nData was provided by the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Dataset and Data Cleaning\n\nWe revisited the airquality_datasets.csv and created pivot tables.\nI Cleaned the data by creating filters and deleting NA values and empty cells, similar to what was done in the first week.\n\nIntroduction to Histograms Professor introduced histograms and their functions, showing their simplicity and effectiveness in presenting data. Exploratory Analysis: Ozone Levels Histogram: The histogram illustrates the variability in ozone levels over time. Key Insights: High ozone levels are notable, but moderate and low levels are more prevalent. Elevated levels are less frequent, while moderate and low concentrations are common.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.3 Saving Files and Folder Organization\nWe learned how to save files properly for each week to ensure Quarto documents render correctly. Instructions: Save everything in the same folder for efficient document rendering.\nOzone vs. Temperature: Scatter Plot Analysis The professor demonstrated a scatter plot comparing ozone levels and temperature. Key Insights: Positive correlation: Higher ozone levels generally occur with higher temperatures. Extreme ozone levels (115, 135, 168) appear with temperatures ranging from 79 to 97. Moderate ozone levels occur between temperatures of 70s to mid-80s. Lower ozone levels align with cooler temperatures. Overall, the scatter plot shows a clear trend of higher ozone levels being linked to warmer temperatures but with significant variability.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.4 Pivot Tables and Charts (Real Class Topic)\nPivot Table Basics:\n\nI Inserted a pivot table on a new sheet.\nSelected variables from the air quality dataset are to be inputted into rows and values. Month will go in row and temp , wind, solar r, ozone in values\nThe professor explained the count, sum, and average options for data analysis.\nFinally, in class, we were asked to create our own version of a pivot table to understand, analyze, and interpret the data.\n\nKey Insights: Higher temperatures and increased solar radiation are linked to higher ozone levels. As heat and sunlight rise, ozone levels generally increase, reflecting their strong correlation. Cooler temperatures and less sunlight lead to lower ozone concentrations, showing that both factors significantly influence ozone levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Friday 09/07/24\n\n2.2.2.1 Work in class\n\ntoday the professor wanted us to go back into the creation of pivot tables,but now we had to make charts from the pivot tables\nwe kept on using on the same data set from from airquality and now we had to come up with as much as possible pivot table.\n\n\n2.2.2.1.1 Pivot Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n\nI did A “Comparative Analysis of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month” using a clustered column chart\n\n\n2.2.2.1.1.1 Key Insights:\n1. Temperature: Highest in row 9 (2230) and lowest in row 6 (704), likely reflecting seasonal or geographic factors.\n2.Wind: Highest wind speed in row 9 (292.2). Row 7 shows lower wind (221.6) despite high temperatures, suggesting terrain or local weather effects.\n3 Solar Radiation: High solar radiation corresponds with high temperatures in rows 7 (5627) and 9 (4878). Lower radiation in row 8 (3981) could be due to cloud cover or atmospheric conditions.\n4. Ozone: Ozone peaks in row 7 (1537), with no clear link to temperature, suggesting factors like pollution or altitude may influence levels.\n5.Wind:Wind generally increases with temperature (row 9: 292.2), but in row 7, lower wind (221.6) despite high temperatures suggests local factors like terrain or weather conditions affecting wind patterns.\n6.Solar Radiation:High solar radiation aligns with higher temperatures (row 7: 5627, row 9: 4878), though row 8’s lower radiation (3981) may be due to cloud cover or atmospheric conditions.\n7.Ozone: Ozone peaks in row 7 (1537), but there’s no clear link to temperature, suggesting factors like pollution, altitude, or industrial activity might influence ozone levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1.2 Pivot Table 2: Minimum Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n1.Solar Radiation: The lowest solar radiation is in row 7 (7), indicating minimal sunlight exposure, possibly due to increased cloud cover, shorter daylight hours, or winter months. Row 6 (37) and row 8 (24) are higher, suggesting more sunlight in those periods.\n2.Temperature:Row 5 has the lowest temperature (57), possibly reflecting a colder season or location. Row 7 (73) represents a slightly warmer period but still marks the minimum temperature in that context.\n3.Wind: The lowest wind speed is found in row 8 (2.3), likely due to calm conditions, while row 6 (8) shows stronger winds, possibly due to more open areas or seasonal wind patterns.\nThese findings point to cooler, calmer, and less sunny conditions in specific months or locations, affected by seasonal or environmental factors.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1.3 Pivot Table 3: Maximum Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n1. Solar Radiation: The highest solar radiation is in row 5 (334), followed closely by row 6 (323). This suggests that these months or locations receive the most sunlight, likely due to clearer skies or longer daylight hours. Temperature:\n2.Temperature: is in row 8 (97), reflecting a very warm period or location. Rows 7 (92) and 9 (93) also show high temperatures, indicating consistently hot conditions during these months. Wind:\n3.Wind: is in row 6 (20.7), which may indicate exposure to more intense weather conditions or open areas. Row 5 (20.1) also shows similarly high wind levels, while other rows exhibit slightly lower values. These findings suggest that rows 5 and 6 experience peak solar radiation and wind, while row 8 stands out for its extreme temperature, reflecting the influence of seasonal or geographical factors on these maximum values.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1.4 Pivot Table 4: Average Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n1,Solar Radiation: The highest average solar radiation is in row 7 (216.4), indicating that this month or location experiences the most consistent sunlight. Row 6 (184.2) and row 5 (182.0) also show relatively high averages, suggesting good sunlight exposure. Row 9 (168.2) and row 8 (173.1) have lower averages, possibly due to cloudier or less sunny periods. Temperature:\n2.Temperature The highest average temperature is in row 7 (83.9), reflecting warmer conditions. Row 8 (83.7) also has a high average temperature, indicating similar warm conditions. Row 6 (78.2) and row 9 (76.9) are cooler, and row 5 (66.5) is the lowest, suggesting cooler temperatures during this period. Wind:\n3. Wind The highest average wind speed is in row 6 (12.2), indicating stronger winds in that period. Row 5 (11.5) also shows relatively high wind speeds, while rows 7 (8.5), 8 (8.9), and 9 (10.1) have lower averages, suggesting calmer conditions.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1.5 Pivot Table 5: Sum of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n1.Temperature: The highest sum of temperature is in row 9 (2230), followed by row 7 (2181). This indicates warmer conditions in these periods. The lowest sum is in row 6 (704), showing cooler conditions. Ozone:\n2.Ozone Row 7 has the highest total ozone (1537), suggesting higher ozone levels during this period. Row 5 has the lowest total ozone (579), indicating reduced ozone levels. Solar Radiation:\n3.Solar R The highest sum of solar radiation is in row 7 (5627), suggesting the most sunlight exposure. Row 6 has the lowest sum (1658), indicating less solar radiation. Wind:\n4.Wind The highest total wind is in row 9 (292.2), showing the most wind activity. Row 6 has the lowest total wind (109.6), reflecting calmer conditions. Trends:\nTemperature and solar radiation generally increase over time from row 6 to row 9, indicating a trend towards warmer and sunnier conditions. Wind shows variability, with the highest value in row 9 and lower values in other rows, suggesting fluctuating wind patterns. Ozone levels are highest in row 7 and lower in row 5, indicating varying ozone concentrations over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Last Week 1 Dataset Overview\nClimate Change and Global Food Production\nYou can download the data used in this analysis from the following link: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/\nStudy Overview\nThe study titled Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production under SRES Emissions and Socio-Economic Scenarios is authored by Ana Iglesias from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and Cynthia Rosenzweig from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Published by NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and managed by CIESIN at Columbia University in March 2010, this research delves into the impact of climate change on global staple crop production, focusing on wheat, rice, and maize.\nMain Focus\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess how climate change might influence the production of staple crops on a global scale. By utilizing crop models and climate scenarios, the study simulates potential yield changes resulting from various environmental and socio-economic factors. It particularly highlights the risks posed by global warming on food security, with a focus on regions prone to drought and famine.\nKey Variables\nThe dataset includes several key variables the only used right now where:\n1. BLS_2_Countries_(SRES)_ABBREVNAME: This represents the name of the country (e.g., Australia).\n2.Fips_code: The country code (e.g., AS for Australia)\n3.WH_2000: Average wheat production from 2000 to 2006 in metric tons, sourced from the FAO.\n4.RI_2000: Average rice production from 2000 to 2006 in metric tons, sourced from the FAO.\n5.MZ_2000: Average maize production from 2000 to 2006 in metric tons, sourced from the FAO\nThe purpose of this research is to evaluate the impacts of climate change on crop yields, specifically in relation to changes in temperature and precipitation. The study aims to identify potential adaptations and variations in yields across different countries and regions. It provides valuable insights into global food supply, price fluctuations, and the risks of hunger exacerbated by climate changes.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Wednesday\n\n3.1.1.1 Cleaning the dataset\nBefore processing and creating visualizations of the dataset, it is important to prep the dataset by cleaning it. There might be N/A values or outliers in the dataset, which needs to be removed and cleaned to create better and more accurate visualizations.\nTo clean the data, there are a few things that can be done: - Finding and highlighting NA values by selecting the range of cells and doing ‘Conditional Formatting’ to ‘Highlight Cells Rules’. - Removing NA values by using the ‘Find and Replace’. Find ‘NA’ and replace it with ‘0’. - Using IF function to check for NA values and replace it accordingly. Ex: =IF(A2=“NA”, “0”, A2)\nAdditionally, upon converting the Swiss dataset from a .csv format into an Excel, the first column of the dataset became combined into one cell.\n\nI fixed the titles that are separated by commas in the one cell by separating the titles into the different respective columns.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Context of dataset\nBefore creating plots and visualizations of the dataset, it is important to know what each title in the columns mead and understand the context of the dataset.\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/swiss.html\nThe dataset contains 47 French-speaking “provinces” in Switzerland at around 1888. During that year, Switzerland was entering a demographic transition, where its fertility rates was beginning to fall from the typical level of underdeveloped countries. There are 6 variables in the dataset, where variables are scaled from 0 to 100, except Cathloic that is scaled from 0 to 1. The definitions of the dataset are as below:\n\nFertility = common standardized fertility measure\nAgriculture = % of males involved in agriculture as occupation\nExamination = % draftees receiving highest mark on army examination\nEducation = % education beyond primary school for draftees.\nCatholic = % ‘catholic’ (as opposed to ‘protestant’).\nInfant.Mortality = live births who live less than 1 year.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Creating Different Basic Visualizations\n\n3.1.1.3.1 Scatterplot 1 - Fertility and Cathlic appear to cluster in two groups with four outliers\nIn creating plots, I utilized Excel’s tool of Recommended Charts, which included a scatterplot of ‘Fertility’ and ‘Catholic’. The scatterplot shown below shows two groups of cluster with four outliers.\n\nAs shown in the scatterplot, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic people seem to have a slightly higher fertility compared to provinces with low percentage of Catholic people.\n\n\n3.1.1.3.2 Scatterplot 2 - Relationship between infant mortality and percentage of Catholic people in a province\n Based on the scatterplot above, infant mortality and Catholic appear to have no apparent relationship. However, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic population appear to has a slightly higher infant mortality, with a few provinces having 25 and more live births in a year. Meanwhile, the provinces with a low percentage of Catholic population appear to have infant mortality mostly in the 15-25 range.\nAside from that, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population or a very low percentage of Catholic population, with the scatterplot showing two clusters on the lower end of Catholic percentage (0-20%) and a higher end of Catholic percentage (80-100%). What do you observe?\n\n\n3.1.1.3.3 Bar Charts\n As mentioned in the discussion above, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population, or a very low percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart shows a high frequency within the 2.15-7.15% of Catholic population that gradually decreases as the percentage approaches 17.15-22.15 and gradually increases again as it approaches the 87.15-92.15 percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart above better visualize the two groups of highly populated Catholic province or lowly populated Catholic province.\n\n\n3.1.1.3.4 Line Chart\n The line chart above clearly shows that there is a direct relationship between examination and education. As the percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees increases, the percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination also increases. The two variables showcase a positive directly correlated relationship. Aside from that, the graph also shows that the 46th province outperformed all of the other provinces with the highest percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees and also the highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination. The 46th province is followed by the 42th province which has the second highest percentage of education beyond primary school and second highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination.\n\n\n3.1.1.3.5 Pie Charts\n The pie chart does not really visualize the agriculture data well, as there are too many percentage classification of males involved in agriculture occupation. However, the pie chart can be made better by making the classifications into 5 groups to see which range of percentage of males involved in agriculture occupation is higher among the other provinces.\n\n\n3.1.1.3.6 Histograms\n The histogram shows a slightly negative skew on the frequency of males involved in agriculture as occupation. The majority of the provinces have males involved in agriculture on the 61.2-71.2% range. The 1.2-11.2% range and the 21.2-31.2% range of males involved in agriculture have the lowest frequency.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.4 What plot represent better the data? why?\nThere isn’t any plot that is more superior that the other, but it wholly depends on the variables being plotted. For instance, the relationship between examination and education can be better represented using a line chart, as a line chart shows a more visible distinction between the variable of examination and education. If using a scatterplot, the many plots in the chart may cause the distinction between the two variables to be less visible, as the two variables are directly correlated and have values very closely to one another.\nOn the other hand, using a scatterplot can better highlight the two groups of highly-populated Catholic provinces and lowly-populated Catholic provinces better than a barchart. The scatterplot can visualize the two groups of clusters on opposite ends, highlighting there there are two major groups in the Swiss: Catholic heavily-populated province or Protestant heavily-populated province\nTherefore,different plots have different uses and can highlight the relationship of some variables better than the other, depending on the context and relationship of the variables being plotted. It is important to explore the different relationships of variables using different charts and plots to better visualize the relationships of the variables in the dataset.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Friday\n\n3.1.2.1 Choosing the source and dataset\n\nThe source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/.\n\nI chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different datasets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.\n\nFor this assignment, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm on which dataset I should choose from and why.\n\nAfter using ChatGPT and exploring the source website some more, I decided to choose the dataset containing Corporate Profits by Industry with this link: https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/6257. I downloaded the whole data lists, as it all involves the relevant corporate profits of different industries and sub-sectors.\n\n\nI think that it would be interesting to visualize how the different industries’ profits vary throughout the years, and whether there are correlations between any industries. I downloaded the dataset as Excel format.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Context of the dataset\nThe dataset contains quarterly data on the corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment for different industries, including non-financial, financial, federal, and many other sub-categories such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and utilities. The data is presented in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted annual rate. To set parameter, the study for this assignment only looks at the 10 year span from first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Cleaning and organizing the dataset\n\nReplacing Series ID with Titles\n\nThe dataset contains columns with Series ID instead of titles. Therefore, it needs to be replaced with the titles, which can be viewed in the other sheet in the same Excel document. - To do this, I copied the first Series ID and paste it on the ‘Find’ tool.\n\n\nThen, I go to the other sheet in the same Excel document to find the same Series ID and locate the title\n\n\n\nAfter locating the title, I copied it and paste it on the dataset sheet to replace the Series ID with the right title.\n\n\n\nRepeat this until all other Series ID are replaced with its title\n\n\nMaking the titles more concise When copy and pasting back the titles to the dataset sheet, I realized that the titles are very long and repetitive. Therefore, I reorganized the title and make it shorter and more concise.\nFormatting the columns to be more organized and neat To do this, I expanded the columns to the right width, and centered the text. Additionally, I also deleted the rows with data outside of the 10 year span from 2014 to 2024, as it is outside the parameter of the this exploration.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.4 Making Visualizations\nIn making visualizations, I utilized Excel’s ‘Recommended Charts’ tool under ‘Insert’. After using the tool, I looked over the data and explore to create more meaningful visualizations on my own.\n\n3.1.2.4.1 Line chart: Average Total Profits in 10 Years\n\nWhen I added a graph from the ‘Recommended Charts’, a new sheet is created along with corporate profits summed into yearly instead of quarterly.\n\n\nTotal corporate profits increase over the 10 year period.\nThere are some significant declines in corporate profits The two major declines occurred in the span of end of quarter of 2019 to end of quarter of 2020. in the late quarter of 2019 to 2020. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the sudden drop in corporate profits, with the lock-down, inflation, and slowdown of the economy. The economy healed in the first two quarters of 2020 as the lock-downs are alleviated, however declined again in the end of quarter of 2020.\nThe private enterprises’ profits appear to be very steadily increasing from first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2024. The total corporate profits appear to be higher than the average total corporate profits dotted line, signifying that the increase in total corporate profits are quite significant.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.4.2 Scatterplot 1: Domestic Industries (Non-financial: Manufacturing) vs. Federal\n\n\n“Domestic Industries: Non-financial: Manufacturing” appears to have an inverse relationship with “Federal”\n\nAs ‘Manufacturing’ is high at a range of 675-825 billion dollars, ‘Federal’ appears to be on hundreds of billion dollars loss. However, as ‘Manufacturing’ decreases to below 600 billion dollars, ‘Federal’s’ corporate profits improved to a range of 50-125 billion dollars.\n\n\n3.1.2.4.3 Scatterplot 2: Wholesale trade vs. Transportation and warehousing\n\n\nAs wholesale trade’s corporate profits increases, the corporate profits in the sub-sector of transportation and warehousing also increases.\n\nThe direct and proportional relationship of the two sub-sectors make sense, as wholesale trade involves purchasing goods in large quantities and reselling them in smaller quantities to businesses and other wholesalers, directly involving transportation and warehousing of the goods.\n\n\n3.1.2.4.4 Barchart: Non-financial vs. Financial Domestic Industry\n\n\nThe non-financial domestic industry’s corporate profits are growing more significantly compared to the financial domestic industry’s stable corporate profits\n\nThe non-financial domestic industry are growing more rapidly, especially in the last half of the decade. The financial domestic industry has over 2500 billions of dollars of corporate profits in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, the financial domestic industry appears to have stable corporate profits throughout the past 10 years, as its corporate profits are varying slightly from year to year and are stuck under 750 billion dollars.\n\n\n3.1.2.4.5 Piechart: Non-financial makes up the majority of the domestic industry’s corporate profits\n\n\nNon-financial domestic industry takes 70% of the domestic industry’s corporate profits, while the rest of the world takes up only 14% of the domestic industry’s corporate profits.\nAs stated in a study, non-financial corporations are responsible for a large share of the economic activity in most advanced economies (Tebrake & O’hagan, n.d.), which maakes sense as a lot of the important sub-sectors belong to the non-financial industry (including manufacturing of durable and non-durable goods, wholesale trade, retail trade, utilities, and information)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.5 References\n\nTebrake, J., & O’hagan, P.

    "text": "3.2 Week 2 - 09/02 ~ 09/06\n\n3.2.1 Wednesday and Friday Work\n\n3.2.1.1 Context of data set\nI am using the ‘airquality’ data set, which is the daily air quality measurements in New York from May 1, 1973, to September 30, 1973. The format is a data frame with 153 observations on 6 variables:\n\nOzone: numeric Ozone (ppb)\nSolar.R: numeric Solar R (lang)\nWind: numeric Wind (mph)\nTemp: numeric Temperature (degrees F)\nMonth: numeric Month (1–12)\nDay: numeric Day of month (1–31)\n\nDetails:\n\nOzone: Mean ozone in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt Island\nSolar.R: Solar radiation in Langleys in the frequency band 4000–7700 Angstroms from 0800 to 1200 hours at Central Park\nWind: Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at LaGuardia Airport\nTemp: Maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport.\n\nSource and reference:\nThe data were obtained from the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).\nChambers, J. M., Cleveland, W. S., Kleiner, B. and Tukey, P. A. (1983) Graphical Methods for Data Analysis. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Uploading and converting the document\n\nI downloaded the airquality data set in .csv format from D2L.\nThen, I uploaded it onto Excel.\n\nSince the format is in .csv, I need to change from ‘Viewing’ to ‘Editing’, and convert the Excel into .xlsx format\n\nAfterwards, I renamed the Excel file and saved it onto the right folder.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Cleaning the data set\nBefore processing and creating visualizations of the dataset, it is important to prep the data set by cleaning it. There might be N/A values or outliers in the dataset, which needs to be removed and cleaned to create better and more accurate visualizations.\nTo clean the data, I used Excel to clean the data and remove all the rows which as NA values.\nHere are the things I did step by step to clean the data set:\n\nFiltering the data set and checking only the NA values\n\n\n\nDelete the rows with NA values\n\n\n\nRepeat on the other columns\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.4 Creating visualizations (Charts + Pivot Tables)\n\n3.2.1.4.1 Histogram: Ozone Distribution\n\n\nThe histogram shows a positively skewed (or right-skewed) distribution which most values are clustered around the left tail of the distribution while the right tail of the distribution is longer\nThe mode of the ozone level is 1-25 ppb.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.4.2 Scatter plot: Ozone vs. Temperature\n\n\nThe scatter plot shows an increasing in trend of both variables. It suggests that ozone depend on temperature, but other factors like the day, month, and solar wind also affect temperature.\nOzone and temperature shows a directly related relationship, where the increase in ozone may cause to an increase in temperature.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.5 Creating a Pivot Table\n\nSelect the data you want to include in the pivot table\n\n\n\nCreate pivot table in a new sheet\n\n\n3. Drag ‘Month’ into the Rows\n\n4. Drag ‘Day’ into Columns\n\n5. Drag ‘Ozone’, ‘Solar.R’, ‘Wind’, ‘Temp’ into Values\n\n\nExplore and drag around the variables in different ways to create more insightful pivot tables\n\n\n3.2.1.5.1 Pivot Table 1: Average of Variables Summary\nMaking visualizations in the form of a pivot table allows us to help understand the data set by allowing the data to be presented from another perspective. We can also choose where to put the values on the pivot table to present the data in different ways.\n\n\nAverage Ozone Levels: Peaks in July (59.1) and August (60.0), while May (24.1) and September (31.4) have the lowest levels.\nAverage Temperature: Highest in July (83.9) and August (83.7), with May (66.5) being the coolest.\nAverage Wind Speed: Highest in June (12.2) and lowest in July (8.5).\nAverage Solar Radiation (Solar.R): Peaks in July (216.4), and the lowest in September (168.2).\nOverall, July and August show higher ozone and temperature levels. Ozone and temperature levels appear to have a directly proportional relationship, with average ozone increasing in May to August and decreasing in September, and average temperature following a similar upward and downward trend throughout the months.\nAverage temperature and solar levels appear to also have a directly proportional relationship, as solar directly affects the temperature.\nOn the other hand, wind speed varies inversely with temperature. Wind speed appears to be increasing from May to June, sharply drops in July, and increasing again in August and September.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.6 Pivot Table 2: Temperature\n\n\nThe pivot table allows us to delve more deeply on the average temperature trend throughout the months and days.\nAs seen from the pivot table, the hottest days appear to be on the end of August (August 28 to August 31) to the beginning of September (September 1 to September 4), with the temperature consistently reaching above 90 degrees throughout those days).\nMeanwhile, the coldest days seem to be in early May, with temperature ranging from 58 degrees to 79 degrees.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.7 Pivot Table 3: Temperature vs. Ozone, Wind, and Solar\n\n\nSolar generally increases with temperature and peaks at temperature 86 lang with an average of 211.6 lang. As seen from the chart, solar fluctuates most significantly among other variables, with values ranging from 20 to 298.5 lang.\nOzone increases as temperature rises, with notable jumps at 71 degrees (15 ppb), 77 degrees (23 ppb), and peaks at 89 degrees (103.5 ppb).\nThe highest average ozone level is 103.5 ppb at 89 degrees in. Meanwhile, ozone appears to be low (&lt;30 degrees) for temperatures below 70 degrees, such as in May and September. This further suggests that ozone and temperature has a directly proportional relationship.\nWind shows a decreasing trend as the temperature rises. Wind peaks at 18.4 mph for 57 degrees and consistently reduces, reaching as low as 4.3 mph at 93 degrees, which shows that wind and temperature are inversely related.\nWind has relatively stable values between 6-10 mph for temperatures above 80 degrees.\nHigher temperatures correlate with lower wind speeds and increased ozone levels. Meanwhile, solar has a fluctuating trend and does not show a consistent pattern with temperature changes.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.8 Bar chart from pivot table\nI selected the pivot table and inserted a bar chart using Excel to visualize the relationship of temperature with solar, ozone, and wind by month. \n\nOzone shows a steady increase from May (5) to July (7), peaks in August (8), and then decreases in September (9).\nTemperature increases gradually from May (5) to July (7), maintains a similar level in August (8) and September (9).\nWind remains relatively low and stable throughout all months, with slight fluctuations.\nSolar peaks sharply in May (5) and July (7), slightly decreases in June (6) and August (8), and remains high in September (9). Solar radiation shows high peaks in May and July.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.9 Line chart from pivot table\nI selected another pivot table and inserted a line chart using Excel to visualize the relationship of temperature with solar, ozone, and wind.\n\n\nThe pivot table allows us to look more closely on the effect of temperature on the other variables (ozone, wind, and solar).\nAs seen on the pivot table and the line chart, the solar levels fluctuate the most among the other variables and seem to generally increase as temperature approaches 97.\nBesides that, ozone follow a similar upward trend as temperature increases, suggesting a directly proportional relationship.\nAdditionally, wind appears to be inversely related with temperature, as it decreases when temperature approaches its maximum.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.10 Findings and takeaways\nWhat and how does the findings pertains to our overall project objective?\n\nThe findings in this assignment allowed me to learn that making visualizations are not just about making different kinds of charts, but also can be in the form of tables -in this case, pivot tables.\nPivot tables are important and can be used strategically to present data from a new set of perspectives by arranging, formatting, and organizing the data in different rows, columns, and values. By presenting the data in a more organized way, we can draw more analysis and correlations of how different variables relate to one another in the data set.\nMaking a more insightful and in-depth analysis of the data set requires a deep exploration by trying to plot data in different ways, formatting them differently (ex: adjusting the min/max values or the bin range of a chart),\n\nI will incorporate the findings from this assignment into the mid-term project, to allow a better exploration and analysis of the FRED data set. Specifically, aside from making different charts (scatter plots, distribution, line chart, etc.), I will also deeply explore the data set variables through pivot tables. Pivot tables allow us to see the data in a different dimension, which is more concise and summarized for better comprehension. As the FRED data set is huge, pivot tables would be very useful in effectively visualizing and finding meaningful correlations and analyses of the variables.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Midterm Project Context\n\n3.2.2.1 Choosing the source and dataset\n\nThe source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/\nI chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different data sets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Context of the FRED data source\nThe FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) data set contains various economic indicators from the U.S., such as employment statistics, inflation rates, GDP data, and other key economic variables. Here’s a breakdown of the context of this data set:\n\n3.2.2.2.1 Variables\nAs the FRED source contains a lot of different datasets, here are only some of the variables included in the dataset source.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product): A measure of the total economic output of a country.\nUnemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work.\nInflation Rate (CPI or PPI): The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.\nInterest Rates: Such as the Federal Funds Rate, which is the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.\nIndustrial Production Index: A measure of the real output of the manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas industries.\nRetail Sales: A measure of the total sales within the retail sector.\nHousing Starts: The number of new residential construction projects that have begun in a given period.\nConsumer Confidence Index: A measure of consumer sentiment about the economy.\nExports and Imports: The total value of goods and services exported and imported by a country.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.2 Who collected the data\nThe data is collected by various U.S. government agencies such as:\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\nThe Federal Reserve Board\nThe U.S. Census Bureau It is then compiled and made available to the public by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis via the FRED platform.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.3 Purpose of the source and data set\n\n3.2.2.2.3.1 The primary purpose of the FRED data set is to provide economic data that can be used for:\n\nEconomic Research and Analysis: By economists, policymakers, and academic researchers to understand economic trends and conditions.\nPolicy Making: By government agencies and the Federal Reserve to inform monetary and fiscal policy decisions.\nMarket Analysis: By financial analysts and investors to forecast economic conditions and make informed decisions.\nEducation: As a resource for students and educators in understanding economic principles and trends.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.3.2 There are several objectives/purposes of the data set that can be relevant fo the mid-tern project. I can delve into the economic indicators over time, such as:\n\nGDP Growth Rate: To observe economic expansion or contraction.\nUnemployment Rate: To identify periods of high or low employment.\nInflation Rate: To detect inflationary or deflationary trends.\nInterest Rates: To understand changes in the cost of borrowing.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.3.3 For comparative analysis, I can also use bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pivot charts, and other visualizatioons to compare different indicators:\n\nInterest Rates vs. Inflation Rates: To show the relationship between monetary policy and inflation.\nGDP vs. Unemployment Rate: To show how economic output correlates with employment levels.\nConsumer Confidence vs. Retail Sales: To visualize how sentiment aligns with spending behavior.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.3.4 For a deeper exploration using the source and data set, I can also create sector-specific visualizations to focus on specific sectors such as manufacturing, housing, or consumer spending:\n\nIndustrial Production Index: To visualize the output of key industries.\nHousing Starts: To visualize the health of the real estate sector.\nRetail Sales by Category: To understand consumer spending patterns.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.3.5 I can create geographical visualizations from different countries that the data set including:\n\nUnemployment Rates by Country: To visualize regional differences in employment.\nGDP Growth by Country: To compare economic performance across different areas.\n\nAdditionally, I can delve into leading and lagging Indicators by visualize leading indicators (like consumer confidence) against lagging indicators (like GDP) to understand potential future economic conditions.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Wednesday\n\n4.1.1.1 Diamonds Dataset\nI applied the learnings and findings from the Excel Unit to another dataset, the diamonds_ggplot2.csv set. -  - The Diamonds dataset defines the different characteristics of a diamond namely, carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, price, and lengths in the x, y, and z direction The dataset itself did not have any NA values, and hence did not need any additional steps for cleaning the data. An interesting observation to be made was that there are several interesting correlations between the columns that can help us observe some basic trends in the diamond trading business. There were more than 53,000 records collected, and so this dataset is very comprehensive!\n\n4.1.1.1.1 Preparing the dataset\nConsidering the size of the dataset, I had to use 500 random records to create my visualizations. Here’s a step by step guide on how I did that.\n\n4.1.1.1.1.1 Add a random number column\n\nChoose a column and add the RAND() function to the column. Double click on the bottom right of the cell to paste the function to the rest of the rows in the dataset. This creates a random number between 0 and 1. \nNext, we apply a filter to the entire dataset, and use the random number column (sorting it from smallest to largest). This automatically rearranges the data records, making the first 500 random. \nCopy the first 500 records to a new sheet. This now becomes your 500 records that give you a true random overview of the Diamonds dataset. \nSince the records didn’t contain any NA values, this looked like the only preparation I needed to do.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.1.1.2 Creating visualizations\n\nScatter Plot: Carat VS Price\n\nThe first plot I created was a scatter plot that visualized the relationship between the carat of the diamond and the price it would sell at \nFrom this, we can see that the dimaonds that have a higher carat sell for more.\n\n\n\nHistogram: Sum of Price by Color\n\nThe next plot I created was a histogram that visualized the relationship between the prices and the color of the diamond. \nFrom this chart, it was clear to see that the diamonds that had the most value were those with the ‘H’ coloration.\n\n\n\nOther charts\n\nWhen trying to create more visualizations, I observed that not all charts were capable of visualizing this data, and furthermore, given the size of the dataset, all operations were much slower on the online excel sheet.\nI believe the best visualization for such data is the Scatter Plot of Price vs Carats, because it captures the inherent reality that more carats means more price. All in all, it was an interesting start to the class and helped me better understand how visualizations can be achieved on excel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Friday\n\n4.1.2.1 NCES Education Dataset\nNCES Education Dataset is extremely vast and includes several different studies conducted over a range of years. Today, we’ll only be focusing the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. You can find out more here\nThe High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) is a comprehensive study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It tracks a cohort of students who began 9th grade in 2009, following them through their high school years and beyond into postsecondary education and the workforce. The study focuses on students’ educational trajectories, especially in STEM, examining factors like course-taking patterns, college aspirations, and career choices. The data collected provides insights into how high school experiences influence long-term educational and career outcomes.\n\n4.1.2.1.1 Working with the datset\n\nThis can be an extremely complicated process. The first step should be to go to the registration page and registering yourself to access all the benefits that NCES datalabs offer. \nThis gives us access to the data lab dashboard. Since we can’t use excel because of the extremely large size, so we’ll have to use the datalabs power stats tool for this. \n\n\n\n4.1.2.1.2 Simple Visualization\n\nConsidering that I couldn’t use excel for this process, it was interesting to see the amount of data and variables I had at my disposal for this project. For example, just the keyword ‘STEM’ has 294 variables attached to it.\nOne comparison I made using the PowerStats tool to create a percentage analysis of the relationship between variables S1 and S3.\n\nS1 looks into how math teachers make math so easy to understand. This is divided as ‘Strongly Agree’, ‘Agree’, ‘Neutral’, ‘Disagree’, ‘Strongly Disagree’\nS3 shows how students might consider STEM as a major.\n\nThis visualization further strengthens the premise that teachers are the defining factors in a lot of the future decisions that students make.\n\n\n\n\nPecentage Analysis\n\n\n\nIt further allowed me to use the bar chart to show this information visually. \n\n\n\n4.1.2.1.3 Inference\n\nThese visualizations make it clear that teachers who help make concepts like math and science easier to understand, help these students choose STEM as a major in university.\nThis insight will further add to the ‘STEM Focused’ dataset that I’ll be building during this semester.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Conclusion\n\nGiven the vastness of this dataset, I believe it’s important for me to better understand and comprehend this dataset, so that I can fully utilize and appreciate all the data collected. Although I wasn’t able to use Excel on this dataset, the skills learned in the previous classes definitely helped set me up for success with this.",

    "text": "4.2 Week 2 - 09/02 ~ 09/06\n\n4.2.1 Wednesday & Friday\n\n4.2.1.1 Data Analysis & Pivot Techniques\nThis week, we focused on using pivot tables and pivot charts on the cleaned dataset from last week, to explore relationships between variables in the dataset. Pivot tables allow for a quick and efficient way to summarize, reorganize, and analyze data without needing to manually group or sort data. They provide insights by aggregating data across categories and displaying results in a table format.\n\nPivot tables: Help summarize large datasets by grouping them according to key variables, allowing for quick identification of patterns and trends.\nPivot charts: Visual representations of the data in pivot tables. These charts help communicate the relationships and trends identified in the data through pivot analysis.\n\nUsing these tools, we were able to gain deeper insights into the environmental data from the airquality dataset. Key relationships between temperature, wind speed, ozone concentration, and solar radiation were analyzed, leading to findings that provided a better understanding of weather and air quality trends.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Context of the AirQuality Dataset\nThe airquality.csv dataset is a popular dataset that contains information about New York’s air quality measurements recorded in the year 1973. It consists of daily readings of various air quality parameters such as ozone concentration, solar radiation, wind speed, and temperature.\n\n4.2.1.2.1 Key Variables:\n\nOzone: The concentration of ozone in parts per billion (ppb).\nSolar.R: Solar radiation in langleys.\nWind: Wind speed in miles per hour.\nTemp: Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.\nMonth: The month during which the data was recorded (from May to September).\nDay: The day of the month.\n\nThis dataset provides valuable insights into how different environmental factors interact over time and can be used to analyze trends related to air pollution and weather patterns.\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Quick Recap of Data Preprocessing\n\n4.2.1.3.1 Download data\nI downloaded a fresh version of the airquality.csv file, and then saved it as a .xlsx file to then manipulate using Excel.\n\n\n\nNew Download of airquality.csv\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3.2 Clean Data\nSince it was a fresh download of the file, we needed to clean the data of any NA values. Here is a high-level overview of the steps we take to achieve this:\n\nStep 1: Apply a filter to the data \nStep 2: Filter for all NA data in a column (in this case, Ozone) \nStep 3: Delete all the rows with an NA value \nStep 4: Repeat for any other columns with NA values \n\nNow we have a clean dataset that we can use to create pivot tables and pivot charts.\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4 Pivot Tables and Insights\n\n4.2.1.4.1 Creating a genearl pivot table\n\nTo create a general pivot table, you first select all the data in your dataset as seen below \nYou then go to the insert tab and click on Pivot Table to insert a pivot table \nHere is where you will specify where you want to insert this new table. As suggested by Dr. V, we’ll insert it into a new sheet. \nThe next step is to select the fields you want to use in your pivot table. These fields can either be dragged and dropped or checked and unchecked. As the names of the boxes suggest, you have the option to add a filter, to add a column, to add a row, or to specify what values you want to use. An interesting point to note here is that you can stack rows and columns, essentially creating a dropdown like effect, making data more manageable and understandable. \nGo ahead and select the fields as below \nAfter the fields have been selected, we now have the option to change the value field settings. This means that we can change the kind of data we interpret from the dataset. \nIn this example, we’re going to change it from the sum to the average values for each field. \nAs part of ‘prettifying’ our data, let’s decrease the decimal places in our data, to only the 2 decimal places. \nAfter some more prettifying, we end up with the following pivot table, your first pivot table! \n\n\n\n4.2.1.4.2 Creating your first pivot chart\n\nNow that we have the pivot table, we can create a pivot chart. To do this, the first step would be to select your pivot table and click on Pivot Chart on the insert tab. \nWe can then select what type of chart we’d like to use. Excel automatically tells you what are possible and what aren’t possible. \nAnd after choosing the appropriate chart type, bar chart in our case, we have created our first pivot chart. Congratulations \nAnother interesting thing you can do with pivot charts, is that we can apply filters to the rows and columns on the chart itself. \n\n\n\n4.2.1.4.3 Pivot Chart Variations\nNow that we know how to create pivot tables and pivot charts, let’s use this knowledge to create comparisons in our dataset to further analyze how these different variables interact with each other.\n\n4.2.1.4.3.1 Pivot Chart 1: Average of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Temperature, Wind by Month and Day\n\nThis is the pivot chart we just created. This chart shows us a few general trends. Specifically:\n\nOzone levels seem to correlate with temperature where higher temperatures in July and August correspond with higher ozone concentrations.\nSolar radiation is also highest in the summer months, contributing to higher temperatures, but interestingly, ozone concentrations are lower in September despite similar solar radiation levels.\nWind speeds decrease as temperatures rise, indicating that calmer wind conditions occur during the hotter summer months, potentially allowing pollutants like ozone to accumulate more in the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nAverage of Ozone, Solar R., Temp, Wind by Month and Day\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4.3.2 Pivot Chart 2: Average Temp vs Average Ozone by Month\n\nThis pivot chart looks at the average values of temperature vs the average values of ozone by month. The general understanding this gives us is that:\n\nThe ozone concentration increases with rising temperature during the summer months, particularly in July and August.\nAfter peaking in the summer, both temperature and ozone levels decrease in September, though the decline in ozone levels is more pronounced than the drop in temperature.\nThis pattern suggests that while temperature is a significant factor in ozone concentration, other elements such as sunlight intensity and wind speed might also contribute to the sudden drop in ozone levels observed in September.\n\n\n\n\nPivot table\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Chart - A trend line on a bar chart\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4.3.3 Pivot Chart 3: Average Solar Radiation vs Average of Wind speeds by Month\n\nThis pivot chart looks at the average values of solar radiation vs the average values of wind speeds by month. Here are the trends we can observe:\n\nThere is an inverse relationship between solar radiation and wind speed during the summer months. As solar radiation peaks in July, wind speeds drop to their lowest levels. This could be due to more stable weather conditions with fewer disturbances (such as storms) that typically bring stronger winds.\nIn the transition months of May and September, the wind speeds are higher, possibly due to more atmospheric variability as seasons change, while solar radiation is moderate.\nThe decrease in wind speed during the summer may contribute to higher ozone levels observed in earlier analyses, as calmer winds allow pollutants to accumulate.\n\n\n\n\nPivot table\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Chart - 2 trend lines with markers with a secondary axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4.4 Pivot Chart Conclusion\n\nThere are several different charts that can be made from this simple dataset, which further demonstrates just how powerful the pivot table and pivot chart features are!\nLearning how to use this feature is definitely going to be helpful in my future endeavors with data.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Midterm Project Context\nThe goal of this midterm project is to analyze data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) to explore how early exposure to STEM education affects future career outcomes. The project will focus on: - How students’ interest in STEM subjects during high school influences their college major and career choices. - The role of parents and school environments in shaping STEM aspirations. - (Possible consideration) A comparative analysis of HSLS:09 and other studies such as ELS:2002 and NELS:88 to identify broader educational trends.\nThis project will aim to answer key questions regarding the role of early STEM education in fostering career readiness and bridging gaps for underrepresented groups in STEM.\n\n4.2.2.1 Introduction to NCES Data Source\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is a key provider of data on education in the U.S., offering a vast array of longitudinal studies, surveys, and tools. The NCES collects comprehensive data that is useful for understanding student pathways, outcomes, and how factors such as socioeconomic status, race, and school characteristics impact education.\n\n4.2.2.1.1 How to Use NCES Data\nYou can access NCES data at NCES Data Tools. The NCES website offers a range of tools that allow users to: - Download datasets for longitudinal studies such as HSLS:09. - Create custom reports using tools like Data Lab. - Visualize educational trends using tools like the Trend Generator.\n\n4.2.2.1.1.1 Related Resources:\n\nNCES Data Lab Tool\nNCES Online Codebook\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2 HSLS Dataset\nThe High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), launched by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), provides a rich source of data for educational research. By tracking students from the beginning of high school through postsecondary education and into their careers, HSLS:09 offers valuable insights into student pathways, especially in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).\nLet’s break down the context of HSLS:09 using the 5 W’s framework to better understand its significance.\n\n4.2.2.2.1 Who?\n\nParticipants: HSLS:09 initially sampled over 23,000 ninth-grade students from 944 high schools across the United States. It also collected data from parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators.\nDemographics: The participants represented a diverse cross-section of students, varying in socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, and geographic locations.\nStakeholders: Aside from students, the survey data also involves insights from educators and family members, making it a comprehensive longitudinal study.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2.2 What?\n\nScope: The HSLS:09 focuses on understanding students’ educational choices, performance, and postsecondary transitions. One of the study’s unique features is its emphasis on STEM education and career trajectories. Cognitive assessments were administered alongside surveys to measure student aptitude in mathematics and science.\nData Collected: The study captures a wide range of data, including academic achievement, cognitive tests, postsecondary aspirations, parental influence, school characteristics, and career goals.\nAssessment: The students underwent math assessments in the ninth grade, and their progress was tracked through follow-up surveys in 2012, 2016, and beyond.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2.3 Where?\n\nGeographic Coverage: The survey covered high schools throughout the United States, including urban, suburban, and rural areas. This allowed for a broad understanding of educational experiences across different geographic and socioeconomic environments.\nPostsecondary Transitions: The follow-up surveys track students as they transition into a variety of postsecondary environments, including two- and four-year colleges, vocational programs, and directly into the workforce.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2.4 When?\n\nInitial Data Collection: The study began in 2009 when the participants were in ninth grade. Subsequent data collection points occurred in 2012, 2013, 2016, and more recently, following students through their postsecondary education and career entry phases.\nLongitudinal Approach: HSLS:09 is designed to track participants over an extended period, providing insights into the long-term effects of high school experiences on educational attainment and career success.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2.5 Why?\n\nSTEM Emphasis: A primary goal of HSLS:09 is to understand how high school experiences, especially in STEM fields, influence later educational and career outcomes. The study explores what motivates students to pursue careers in STEM and what barriers may exist, such as socioeconomic factors or lack of resources.\nEducational Equity: Another key objective is to assess educational equity. HSLS:09 allows researchers to examine disparities in student experiences based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location, providing a wealth of information for policymakers.\nPolicy Implications: The data serves as a foundation for designing interventions that can address gaps in education, particularly for underrepresented groups in STEM.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2.6 How?\n\nMethodology: HSLS:09 uses a combination of surveys, cognitive assessments, and follow-up interviews to gather data. The study includes input from students, parents, educators, and administrators, creating a holistic view of each student’s educational journey.\nAnalysis Frameworks: Researchers use the HSLS:09 data to conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The longitudinal design enables researchers to look at changes over time, such as shifts in career aspirations or academic performance.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2.7 Conclusion\nThe HSLS:09 dataset offers invaluable insights into the educational trajectories of U.S. high school students, with a particular focus on STEM fields. The data gathered from this study can be used to develop strategies that support student success, particularly in underrepresented communities. For this midterm project, analyzing this dataset allows us to explore key questions about educational pathways, parental influence, and career readiness, providing a solid foundation for research in educational policy and student development.",
