The higher the rating the higher the complaint attitude\n\n-Statics chart helpful in showing where the concentration of the overall data is.\n\n-Best graph that represent the data was Scatter plot, \n-\\>Easier to individual points and groups. \n-\\>Can apply basic functions, or understanding to see trends \n-\\> Overall seem that those with Combative attitudes excelled, those who were humble seemed to a had a positive trend and privileged posh attitudes performed worse than counterparts.\n\n#### Summary\n\n-Applied skills learned from Monday -Found trends patterns and made conclusions -Researched possible data sets and other techniques\n\n### Friday\n\n#### Overview\n\n-Cleaning and filtering data in relation to soil samples\n-Applying techniques learned from Monday and Wednesday to data set\n-Document all necessary actions for repeatable research\n-Find a story in the data\n\n\n#### Data Information\n\n-Data is from the USDA\n-Multiple different data sets that could be chosen\n->Friday's focuses on solid yield from 1984 - 1993\n-Specific data can be found pressing the link\n[Data from Tillage and cropping effects on soil quality indicators in the northern Great Plains](https://agdatacommons.nal.usda.gov/articles/dataset/Data_from_Tillage_and_cropping_effects_on_soil_quality_indicators_in_the_northern_Great_Plains/26673769?file=48572716)\n\n-The study provides insights into how soil properties respond to crop rotation and tillage practices under rainfed conditions in a semiarid continental climate\n\n##### Column Name and Information\nPLOT: Plot number, identifying the specific plot where the data was collected.\nREP: Replicate number, indicating the repetition of the experiment or sampling within the plot.\nROTATION: Crop rotation system used in the experiment, typically represented by a code.\n-TILLAGE: Tillage treatment, also represented by a code (e.g., T1, T2).\n-DEPTH: Soil sampling depth (in cm).\n-SBD: Soil bulk density (g/cmÂ³).\n-EC: Electrical conductivity (dS/m), a measure of soil salinity.\n-PH: Soil pH level.\n-NO3N: Nitrate nitrogen (mg/kg), an indicator of soil nitrogen content.\n-SOC: Soil organic carbon (mg/kg).\n-TN: Total nitrogen (mg/kg).\n-PMN: Potentially mineralizable nitrogen (mg/kg).\n-POMLF: Particulate organic matter light fraction (mg/kg).\n-POMSF: Particulate organic matter small fraction (mg/kg).\n-POMT: Total particulate organic matter (mg/kg).\n-POMSOM: Particulate organic matter as a percentage of soil organic matter.\n-MBC: Microbial biomass carbon (mg/kg).\n-MBN: Microbial biomass nitrogen (mg/kg)\n\n#### Intial Observation\n\n(How to Follow) -Select group of Cells, Rows or Columns\n-Select column with depth,(Step1)\n-select all 7.5cm (Step2)\n-shift arrow -> 4 rows (Step3)\n-In the setting insert, select graph or recommend graph(Step4)\n-For this we used a Column cluster(reccomended)\n\n##### 7.5 cm depth\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil1.png) \n\n\n##### 15 cm depth\n\n-Repeats steps, changing 7.5 to 15\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil2.png) \n\n##### 30 cm depth\n\n-Repeats steps, changing 7.5 to 30\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil3.png) \n\n\n#### observations\n\n-On Graphs 2 & 3 seem to lacking a series 4 and both have high series 7\n-On Graph 1 lacks series 5-7 and series \n\n\n#### Focus + 2nd graph\n\n-Focused on 2 columns ph and NO3N\n->PH level and nitrogen.\n\n-Highlighted each PH and NO3N for each respective depth\n-Selected graphs for each a line graph\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil4.png)\n\n##### Observations\n\n-Depth seems to correlate to steadier levels in PH and N03N to 15cm\n-15cm depth seems to the best to hold consistent level in PH and N03N\n-7.5cm depth has the largest variance highest Max in NO3n\n-30cm depth had the lowest valley in NO3N\n\n\n#### Formatting \n\n-Highlight cells rule, less than value (6.25)\n-Highlighted each PH and NO3N for each respective depth\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Diego/Week_1DJ/screenshots/Soil5.png)\n##### Observations\n\n-30 + 15 cm depths' nitrogen is below 6.25 cm\n-7.5cm depth's PH is below 6.25\n\n\n#### Summary\n\n-Worked with team lead and Professor at data sets and possible ideas \n-Discussed what expectations were set and what documentation should look like \n-Worked on USDA data set\n-Applied skills and tools to dataset\n\n#### Notes for next work\n-Larger and more background information on a dataset is useful\n-Lacked comparsion test to 1984 data set\n-Extended research into subject provides a working platform\n-Large data sets become complicated to work with and see at once on excel\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"diego.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
