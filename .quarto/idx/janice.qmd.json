There might be N/A values or outliers in the dataset, which needs to be removed and cleaned to create better and more accurate visualizations.\n\nTo clean the data, there are a few things that can be done: - Finding and highlighting NA values by selecting the range of cells and doing 'Conditional Formatting' to 'Highlight Cells Rules'. - Removing NA values by using the 'Find and Replace'. Find 'NA' and replace it with '0'. - Using IF function to check for NA values and replace it accordingly. Ex: =IF(A2=\"NA\", \"0\", A2)\n\nAdditionally, upon converting the Swiss dataset from a .csv format into an Excel, the first column of the dataset became combined into one cell.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_cleaning.png)\n\nI fixed the titles that are separated by commas in the one cell by separating the titles into the different respective columns.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_cleaning2.png)\n\n### Context of dataset\n\nBefore creating plots and visualizations of the dataset, it is important to know what each title in the columns mead and understand the context of the dataset.\n\n<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/swiss.html>\n\nThe dataset contains 47 French-speaking \"provinces\" in Switzerland at around 1888. During that year, Switzerland was entering a demographic transition, where its fertility rates was beginning to fall from the typical level of underdeveloped countries. There are 6 variables in the dataset, where variables are scaled from 0 to 100, except Cathloic that is scaled from 0 to 1. The definitions of the dataset are as below:\n\n-   Fertility = common standardized fertility measure\n-   Agriculture = % of males involved in agriculture as occupation\n-   Examination = % draftees receiving highest mark on army examination\n-   Education = % education beyond primary school for draftees.\n-   Catholic = % 'catholic' (as opposed to 'protestant').\n-   Infant.Mortality = live births who live less than 1 year.\n\n### Creating Different Basic Visualizations\n\n#### Scatterplot 1 - Fertility and Cathlic appear to cluster in two groups with four outliers\n\nIn creating plots, I utilized Excel's tool of Recommended Charts, which included a scatterplot of 'Fertility' and 'Catholic'. The scatterplot shown below shows two groups of cluster with four outliers.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_scatterplot.png)\n\nAs shown in the scatterplot, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic people seem to have a slightly higher fertility compared to provinces with low percentage of Catholic people.\n\n#### Scatterplot 2 - Relationship between infant mortality and percentage of Catholic people in a province\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_scatterplot2.png) Based on the scatterplot above, infant mortality and Catholic appear to have no apparent relationship. However, provinces with higher percentage of Catholic population appear to has a slightly higher infant mortality, with a few provinces having 25 and more live births in a year. Meanwhile, the provinces with a low percentage of Catholic population appear to have infant mortality mostly in the 15-25 range.\n\nAside from that, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population or a very low percentage of Catholic population, with the scatterplot showing two clusters on the lower end of Catholic percentage (0-20%) and a higher end of Catholic percentage (80-100%). What do you observe?\n\n#### Bar Charts\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_barchart.png) As mentioned in the discussion above, the provinces in Swiss appear to have either a very high percentage of Catholic population, or a very low percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart shows a high frequency within the 2.15-7.15% of Catholic population that gradually decreases as the percentage approaches 17.15-22.15 and gradually increases again as it approaches the 87.15-92.15 percentage of Catholic population. The bar chart above better visualize the two groups of highly populated Catholic province or lowly populated Catholic province.\n\n#### Line Chart\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_linechart.png) The line chart above clearly shows that there is a direct relationship between examination and education. As the percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees increases, the percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination also increases. The two variables showcase a positive directly correlated relationship. Aside from that, the graph also shows that the 46th province outperformed all of the other provinces with the highest percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees and also the highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination. The 46th province is followed by the 42th province which has the second highest percentage of education beyond primary school and second highest percentage of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination.\n\n#### Pie Charts\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_piechart.png) The pie chart does not really visualize the agriculture data well, as there are too many percentage classification of males involved in agriculture occupation. However, the pie chart can be made better by making the classifications into 5 groups to see which range of percentage of males involved in agriculture occupation is higher among the other provinces.\n\n#### Histograms\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Wednesday/Swiss_histogram.png) The histogram shows a slightly negative skew on the frequency of males involved in agriculture as occupation. The majority of the provinces have males involved in agriculture on the 61.2-71.2% range. The 1.2-11.2% range and the 21.2-31.2% range of males involved in agriculture have the lowest frequency.\n\n### What plot represent better the data? why?\n\nThere isn't any plot that is more superior that the other, but it wholly depends on the variables being plotted. For instance, the relationship between examination and education can be better represented using a line chart, as a line chart shows a more visible distinction between the variable of examination and education. If using a scatterplot, the many plots in the chart may cause the distinction between the two variables to be less visible, as the two variables are directly correlated and have values very closely to one another.\n\nOn the other hand, using a scatterplot can better highlight the two groups of highly-populated Catholic provinces and lowly-populated Catholic provinces better than a barchart. The scatterplot can visualize the two groups of clusters on opposite ends, highlighting there there are two major groups in the Swiss: Catholic heavily-populated province or Protestant heavily-populated province\n\nTherefore,different plots have different uses and can highlight the relationship of some variables better than the other, depending on the context and relationship of the variables being plotted. It is important to explore the different relationships of variables using different charts and plots to better visualize the relationships of the variables in the dataset.\n\n\n## Friday\n\n### Choosing the source and dataset\n\n-   The source that I chose for this class is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), with the link: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>.\n\nI chose the FRED source because I would like to delve more into the US economy to conduct economic analysis and financial research as a business major. Additionally, there are a lot of different datasets, including from different countries, that I an explore from the source.\n\n-   For this assignment, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm on which dataset I should choose from and why.\n\nAfter using ChatGPT and exploring the source website some more, I decided to choose the dataset containing Corporate Profits by Industry with this link: <https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/6257>. I downloaded the whole data lists, as it all involves the relevant corporate profits of different industries and sub-sectors.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Download_data.png)\n\n-   I think that it would be interesting to visualize how the different industries' profits vary throughout the years, and whether there are correlations between any industries. I downloaded the dataset as Excel format.\n\n### Context of the dataset\n\nThe dataset contains quarterly data on the corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment for different industries, including non-financial, financial, federal, and many other sub-categories such as manufacturing, wholesale trade, and utilities. The data is presented in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted annual rate. To set parameter, the study for this assignment only looks at the 10 year span from first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2024.\n\n### Cleaning and organizing the dataset\n\n1.  Replacing Series ID with Titles\n\nThe dataset contains columns with Series ID instead of titles. Therefore, it needs to be replaced with the titles, which can be viewed in the other sheet in the same Excel document. - To do this, I copied the first Series ID and paste it on the 'Find' tool.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Replacing_column_titles.png)\n\n-   Then, I go to the other sheet in the same Excel document to find the same Series ID and locate the title\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Replacing_column_titles2.png)\n\n-   After locating the title, I copied it and paste it on the dataset sheet to replace the Series ID with the right title.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Replacing_column_titles3.png)\n\n-   Repeat this until all other Series ID are replaced with its title\n\n2.  Making the titles more concise When copy and pasting back the titles to the dataset sheet, I realized that the titles are very long and repetitive. Therefore, I reorganized the title and make it shorter and more concise.\n\n3.  Formatting the columns to be more organized and neat To do this, I expanded the columns to the right width, and centered the text. Additionally, I also deleted the rows with data outside of the 10 year span from 2014 to 2024, as it is outside the parameter of the this exploration.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Cleaned_and_organized_data.png)\n\n### Making Visualizations\n\nIn making visualizations, I utilized Excel's 'Recommended Charts' tool under 'Insert'. After using the tool, I looked over the data and explore to create more meaningful visualizations on my own.\n\n#### Line chart: Average Total Profits in 10 Years\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Average_CP.png)\n\nWhen I added a graph from the 'Recommended Charts', a new sheet is created along with corporate profits summed into yearly instead of quarterly.\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Linechart.png)\n\n-   Total corporate profits increase over the 10 year period.\n-   There are some significant declines in corporate profits The two major declines occurred in the span of end of quarter of 2019 to end of quarter of 2020. in the late quarter of 2019 to 2020. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the sudden drop in corporate profits, with the lock-down, inflation, and slowdown of the economy. The economy healed in the first two quarters of 2020 as the lock-downs are alleviated, however declined again in the end of quarter of 2020.\n-   The private enterprises' profits appear to be very steadily increasing from first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2024. The total corporate profits appear to be higher than the average total corporate profits dotted line, signifying that the increase in total corporate profits are quite significant.\n\n#### Scatterplot 1: Domestic Industries (Non-financial: Manufacturing) vs. Federal\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Scatterplot1.png)\n\n-   \"Domestic Industries: Non-financial: Manufacturing\" appears to have an inverse relationship with \"Federal\"\n\nAs 'Manufacturing' is high at a range of 675-825 billion dollars, 'Federal' appears to be on hundreds of billion dollars loss. However, as 'Manufacturing' decreases to below 600 billion dollars, 'Federal's' corporate profits improved to a range of 50-125 billion dollars.\n\n#### Scatterplot 2: Wholesale trade vs. Transportation and warehousing\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Scatterplot2.png)\n\n-   As wholesale trade's corporate profits increases, the corporate profits in the sub-sector of transportation and warehousing also increases.\n\nThe direct and proportional relationship of the two sub-sectors make sense, as wholesale trade involves purchasing goods in large quantities and reselling them in smaller quantities to businesses and other wholesalers, directly involving transportation and warehousing of the goods.\n\n#### Barchart: Non-financial vs. Financial Domestic Industry\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Barchart.png)\n\n-   The non-financial domestic industry's corporate profits are growing more significantly compared to the financial domestic industry's stable corporate profits\n\nThe non-financial domestic industry are growing more rapidly, especially in the last half of the decade. The financial domestic industry has over 2500 billions of dollars of corporate profits in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, the financial domestic industry appears to have stable corporate profits throughout the past 10 years, as its corporate profits are varying slightly from year to year and are stuck under 750 billion dollars.\n\n#### Piechart: Non-financial makes up the majority of the domestic industry's corporate profits\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Janice/Week 1/Week 1 Friday/Piechart.png)\n\n-   Non-financial domestic industry takes 70% of the domestic industry's corporate profits, while the rest of the world takes up only 14% of the domestic industry's corporate profits.\n-   As stated in a study, non-financial corporations are responsible for a large share of the economic activity in most advanced economies (Tebrake & O'hagan, n.d.), which maakes sense as a lot of the important sub-sectors belong to the non-financial industry (including manufacturing of durable and non-durable goods, wholesale trade, retail trade, utilities, and information)\n\n### References\n\n-   Tebrake, J., & O'hagan, P.
