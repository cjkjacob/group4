This might indicate special circumstances or different economic conditions during those periods. The two variables don't seem to have a strong linear relationship. The points are fairly scattered, indicating that changes in the personal saving rate don't consistently correlate with changes in the median duration of unemployment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways from Professor V.\n\n**Understanding Context:**\n\n1.  It's crucial to understand the context of your dataset before deciding on the type of visualization.\n\n2.  Once the dataset is understood, choose visualizations that effectively compare relationships between columns (e.g., petal length vs. petal width in another example; in this case, `psavert` vs. `uempmed`).\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(355).png)\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(356).png)\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(360).png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Friday\n\n#### Class Activity\n\nToday, we worked in class with our groups, focusing on our individual datasets. I chose to work with NASA Earth Data, a resource I'll be utilizing throughout the semester.\n\n#### Dataset Exploration\n\nI began by exploring the [NASA Earth Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) portal, which offers a broad range of datasets across various topics like the atmosphere, earth quality, biosphere, human dimensions, and sun-earth interactions. Each main topic is further divided into subtopics, where users can download data in formats like CSV and Excel.\n\nThe portal also features a \"Learn\" section that provides tutorials and guides on how to read and use the data particularly useful for those new to the platform.\n\n#### Dataset Selection\n\nI was particularly interested in the \"Human Dimensions\" topic, which explores how humans interact with Earth's resources. After filtering the available datasets by format (CSV and Excel) and sorting by the oldest end date, I selected the dataset titled **Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production from SRES Emissions and Socioeconomic Scenarios**.\n\nThis dataset caught my attention because global food production has always been of interest to me, especially considering the drastic changes in soil quality and agricultural methods over the years. Additionally, the way human activities have affected the soil and food production varies significantly by country.\n\n#### Dataset Overview\n\n*Climate Change and Global Food Production*\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe agricultural sector is facing significant challenges due to population growth, land degradation, and urbanization, all of which threaten global food production. Climate change is expected to intensiy these challenges, particularly in regions vulnerable to drought and famine.\n\nA NASA study used crop modeling to assess the impacts of climate change on food production. The study emphasizes that water availability and temperature are critical factors affecting crop yields. It also considers the effects of CO2 and suggests that climate change could have a significant impact on global food production, prices, and the risk of hunger.\n\n#### Data Analysis\n\n1.  I downloaded the dataset and opened it in Excel to begin the data cleaning process. The dataset covers average crop production for various countries from 2000-2006. For this analysis, I focused on the variables: country code, wheat, rice, maize, and added a new variable for the year.\n    I first calculated the mean, maximum, and minimum production values for each country for wheat, rice, and maize. China had the highest production values across all three variables---wheat, rice, and maize. On the other hand, Venezuela had the lowest production for wheat, Saudi Arabia for rice, and Japan for maize. To visualize this, I created a 100% stacked column chart. The graph shows that maize is the most produced crop across all countries, while wheat and rice exhibit irregular consistency over the years from 2000 to 2006. ![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot (372).png)\n\n2.  Next, I created a pie chart to confirm my hypothesis. The chart reveals that maize has the highest average production among the three crops, suggesting it might be more widely cultivated or more important in global agriculture compared to wheat and rice. Rice also has a relatively high average production, indicating its global importance as a staple food. Wheat, despite having the lowest average production among the three, still shows a substantial amount.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(373).png)\n\n3.  . Additionally, I created another stacked column chart to view the crop production across all 74 countries. This broader analysis revealed that China has the highest production numbers, while Switzerland has the lowest. I calculated the average production for each crop for each country and determined the maximum and minimum average production across the three crops for each country. The results show Switzerland with the lowest average production overall, and India with the second highest average production, as reflected in the graph.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(374).png)\n\n4.  In the scatter plot, I observed a strong relationship between the production of wheat and rice. China and India were identified as clear outliers with extremely high production values for all crops. This plot helps in visualizing the tendencies and relationships between the production levels of different crops across countries.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(375).png)\n\n5.  Then created a line graph to analyze production trends over time. Although China and India have the highest production points, the chart reveals a lack of consistency in their production levels. In contrast, wheat and maize, while showing lower production values, exhibit more consistent levels across countries. Nations with consistently low production lines may face agricultural challenges or have less focus on these crops.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(376).png)\n\n#### Summarize insights\n\n1.  China (CHN) leads in production with the highest values across all crops---wheat, rice, and maize---showing significant output in each category.\n\n2.  Switzerland (SW) exhibits the lowest production values across all crops, indicating minimal agricultural output.\n\n3.  China has the highest average production per country, reflecting its extensive agricultural operations and capacity.\n\n4.  Countries with low average production, such as Switzerland and Swaziland, highlight their limited agricultural activities and output.\n\n5.  Maize has the highest maximum production values across several countries, underscoring its significant role in global agriculture.\n\n6.  Rice shows high production values in several countries, including China and India, emphasizing its importance as a staple food.\n\n7.  Wheat production is relatively high in several countries but is not as dominant as maize or rice.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"samuel.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
