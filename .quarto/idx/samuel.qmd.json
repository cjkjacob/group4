{"title":"NASA Earth Data - Samuel Zelaya","markdown":{"headingText":"NASA Earth Data - Samuel Zelaya","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## Week 1 - 08/26 ~ 08/30\n\n### Wednesday\n\n#### Recap and Quarto Document Guidance\n\n**Activity:** The class began with a more in-depth explanation of Quarto documents for those unfamiliar with the process.\n\n**Topics Covered:**\n\n1.Naming and building Quarto notes.\n\n2.Professor V. used a student example to create a small Excel sheet based on the student's daily food intake and corresponding calorie count.\n\n3.He built a graph of the food items and their calorie counts, then demonstrated how to insert the graph into a Quarto document.\n\n4.Provided guidance on how to log the information effectively within Quarto to meet his expectations.\n\n#### Practical Application: Excel Data Visualization\n\n**Activity:** Continued from Monday's class.\n\n**1.Task:** Repeated the data cleaning and visualization process with a different dataset.\n\n**2.Dataset Used:** Economics dataset.\n\n**3.Data Preparation:** - Checked for NA values or empty cells (none were found). - Sorted the data in ascending order based on date values. - Focused on the relationship between `psavert` (personal savings rate) and `uempmed` (median duration of unemployment).\n\n#### Data Visualization Process\n\n**1.Graphs Created: I** Created a line , bar graphs and scatter plot, to find which ne was the easiest to interpreted to explore the relationship between `psavert` and `uempmed` from different perspectives.\n\n**2.Final Choice:** I selected scatter plot graph, the line bar graph i found it unclear how to interpret the scatter plot provided a clearer and easier-to-read visualization of the data.\n\n**3.Additional Observations:**\n\nThere are a few points where the personal saving rate is relatively low. This might indicate special circumstances or different economic conditions during those periods. The two variables don't seem to have a strong linear relationship. The points are fairly scattered, indicating that changes in the personal saving rate don't consistently correlate with changes in the median duration of unemployment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways from Professor V.\n\n**Understanding Context:**\n\n1.  It's crucial to understand the context of your dataset before deciding on the type of visualization.\n\n2.  Once the dataset is understood, choose visualizations that effectively compare relationships between columns (e.g., petal length vs. petal width in another example; in this case, `psavert` vs. `uempmed`).\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(355).png)\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(356).png)\n\n![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(360).png)\n\n\n\n### Friday\n\n#### Class Activity\n\nToday, we worked in class with our groups, focusing on our individual datasets. I chose to work with NASA Earth Data, a resource I'll be utilizing throughout the semester.\n\n#### Dataset Exploration\n\nI began by exploring the [NASA Earth Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) portal, which offers a broad range of datasets across various topics like the atmosphere, earth quality, biosphere, human dimensions, and sun-earth interactions. Each main topic is further divided into subtopics, where users can download data in formats like CSV and Excel.\n\nThe portal also features a \"Learn\" section that provides tutorials and guides on how to read and use the data particularly useful for those new to the platform.\n\n#### Dataset Selection\n\nI was particularly interested in the \"Human Dimensions\" topic, which explores how humans interact with Earth's resources. After filtering the available datasets by format (CSV and Excel) and sorting by the oldest end date, I selected the dataset titled **Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production from SRES Emissions and Socioeconomic Scenarios**.\n\nThis dataset caught my attention because global food production has always been of interest to me, especially considering the drastic changes in soil quality and agricultural methods over the years. Additionally, the way human activities have affected the soil and food production varies significantly by country.\n\n#### Dataset Overview\n\n*Climate Change and Global Food Production*\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe agricultural sector is facing significant challenges due to population growth, land degradation, and urbanization, all of which threaten global food production. Climate change is expected to intensiy these challenges, particularly in regions vulnerable to drought and famine.\n\nA NASA study used crop modeling to assess the impacts of climate change on food production. The study emphasizes that water availability and temperature are critical factors affecting crop yields. It also considers the effects of CO2 and suggests that climate change could have a significant impact on global food production, prices, and the risk of hunger.\n\n#### Data Analysis\n\n1.  I downloaded the dataset and opened it in Excel to begin the data cleaning process. The dataset covers average crop production for various countries from 2000-2006. For this analysis, I focused on the variables: country code, wheat, rice, maize, and added a new variable for the year.\n    I first calculated the mean, maximum, and minimum production values for each country for wheat, rice, and maize. China had the highest production values across all three variables---wheat, rice, and maize. On the other hand, Venezuela had the lowest production for wheat, Saudi Arabia for rice, and Japan for maize. To visualize this, I created a 100% stacked column chart. The graph shows that maize is the most produced crop across all countries, while wheat and rice exhibit irregular consistency over the years from 2000 to 2006. ![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot (372).png)\n\n2.  Next, I created a pie chart to confirm my hypothesis. The chart reveals that maize has the highest average production among the three crops, suggesting it might be more widely cultivated or more important in global agriculture compared to wheat and rice. Rice also has a relatively high average production, indicating its global importance as a staple food. Wheat, despite having the lowest average production among the three, still shows a substantial amount.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(373).png)\n\n3.  . Additionally, I created another stacked column chart to view the crop production across all 74 countries. This broader analysis revealed that China has the highest production numbers, while Switzerland has the lowest. I calculated the average production for each crop for each country and determined the maximum and minimum average production across the three crops for each country. The results show Switzerland with the lowest average production overall, and India with the second highest average production, as reflected in the graph.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(374).png)\n\n4.  In the scatter plot, I observed a strong relationship between the production of wheat and rice. China and India were identified as clear outliers with extremely high production values for all crops. This plot helps in visualizing the tendencies and relationships between the production levels of different crops across countries.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(375).png)\n\n5.  Then created a line graph to analyze production trends over time. Although China and India have the highest production points, the chart reveals a lack of consistency in their production levels. In contrast, wheat and maize, while showing lower production values, exhibit more consistent levels across countries. Nations with consistently low production lines may face agricultural challenges or have less focus on these crops.![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Samuel/Screenshot(376).png)\n\n#### Summarize insights\n\n1.  China (CHN) leads in production with the highest values across all crops---wheat, rice, and maize---showing significant output in each category.\n\n2.  Switzerland (SW) exhibits the lowest production values across all crops, indicating minimal agricultural output.\n\n3.  China has the highest average production per country, reflecting its extensive agricultural operations and capacity.\n\n4.  Countries with low average production, such as Switzerland and Swaziland, highlight their limited agricultural activities and output.\n\n5.  Maize has the highest maximum production values across several countries, underscoring its significant role in global agriculture.\n\n6.  Rice shows high production values in several countries, including China and India, emphasizing its importance as a staple food.\n\n7.  Wheat production is relatively high in several countries but is not as dominant as maize or rice.\n\n\n\n## Week 2 - 09/02 ~ 09/06\n\n### Wednesday\n\n#### New York Air Quality Dataset\n\n##### **Description**\n\nThe dataset contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. It focuses on six key variables related to atmospheric conditions: ozone levels, solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, month, and day. The data helps analyze the relationship between these variables and environmental factors.\n\n##### **Variables**\n\n1.  **Ozone** (ppb): Measured between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM at Roosevelt Island.\n2.  **Solar.R** (Langleys): Solar radiation measured from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM at Central Park.\n3.  **Wind** (mph): Average wind speed at LaGuardia Airport, recorded between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM.\n4.  **Temp** (Â°F): Maximum daily temperature at LaGuardia Airport.\n5.  **Month**: Numeric (1 = May, 9 = September).\n6.  **Day**: Day of the month.\n\n##### **Source**\n\nData was provided by the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).\n\n#### Dataset and Data Cleaning\n\n1.  We revisited the airquality_datasets.csv and created pivot tables.\n2.  I Cleaned the data by creating filters and deleting NA values and empty cells, similar to what was done in the first week.\n\n**Introduction to Histograms** Professor introduced histograms and their functions, showing their simplicity and effectiveness in presenting data. Exploratory Analysis: Ozone Levels Histogram: The histogram illustrates the variability in ozone levels over time. Key Insights: High ozone levels are notable, but moderate and low levels are more prevalent. Elevated levels are less frequent, while moderate and low concentrations are common.\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(379).png)\n\n#### **Saving Files and Folder Organization**\n\nWe learned how to save files properly for each week to ensure Quarto documents render correctly. Instructions: Save everything in the same folder for efficient document rendering.\n\n**Ozone vs. Temperature: Scatter Plot Analysis** The professor demonstrated a scatter plot comparing ozone levels and temperature. Key Insights: Positive correlation: Higher ozone levels generally occur with higher temperatures. Extreme ozone levels (115, 135, 168) appear with temperatures ranging from 79 to 97. Moderate ozone levels occur between temperatures of 70s to mid-80s. Lower ozone levels align with cooler temperatures. Overall, the scatter plot shows a clear trend of higher ozone levels being linked to warmer temperatures but with significant variability.\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(381).png)\n\n#### Pivot Tables and Charts (Real Class Topic)\n\n**Pivot Table Basics:**\n\n1.  I Inserted a pivot table on a new sheet.\n2.  Selected variables from the air quality dataset are to be inputted into rows and values. Month will go in row and temp , wind, solar r, ozone in values\n3.  The professor explained the count, sum, and average options for data analysis.\n4.  Finally, in class, we were asked to create our own version of a pivot table to understand, analyze, and interpret the data.\n\n**Key Insights:** Higher temperatures and increased solar radiation are linked to higher ozone levels. As heat and sunlight rise, ozone levels generally increase, reflecting their strong correlation. Cooler temperatures and less sunlight lead to lower ozone concentrations, showing that both factors significantly influence ozone levels.\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(398).png)\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(380).png)\n\n### Friday 09/07/24\n\n#### **Work in class**\n\n1.  today the professor wanted us to go back into the creation of pivot tables,but now we had to make charts from the pivot tables\n\n2.  we kept on using on the same data set from from airquality and now we had to come up with as much as possible pivot table.\n\n##### **Pivot Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month**\n\n1.  I did A \"Comparative Analysis of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\" using a clustered column chart\n\n###### **Key Insights:**\n\n**1. Temperature:** Highest in row 9 (2230) and lowest in row 6 (704), likely reflecting seasonal or geographic factors.\n\n**2.Wind:** Highest wind speed in row 9 (292.2). Row 7 shows lower wind (221.6) despite high temperatures, suggesting terrain or local weather effects.\n\n**3 Solar Radiation:** High solar radiation corresponds with high temperatures in rows 7 (5627) and 9 (4878). Lower radiation in row 8 (3981) could be due to cloud cover or atmospheric conditions.\n\n**4. Ozone:** Ozone peaks in row 7 (1537), with no clear link to temperature, suggesting factors like pollution or altitude may influence levels.\n\n**5.Wind:**Wind generally increases with temperature (row 9: 292.2), but in row 7, lower wind (221.6) despite high temperatures suggests local factors like terrain or weather conditions affecting wind patterns.\n\n**6.Solar Radiation:**High solar radiation aligns with higher temperatures (row 7: 5627, row 9: 4878), though row 8's lower radiation (3981) may be due to cloud cover or atmospheric conditions.\n\n**7.Ozone:** Ozone peaks in row 7 (1537), but there's no clear link to temperature, suggesting factors like pollution, altitude, or industrial activity might influence ozone levels.\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(399).png)\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(389).png)\n\n##### Pivot Table 2: Minimum Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n\n**1.Solar Radiation**: The lowest solar radiation is in row 7 (7), indicating minimal sunlight exposure, possibly due to increased cloud cover, shorter daylight hours, or winter months. Row 6 (37) and row 8 (24) are higher, suggesting more sunlight in those periods.\n\n**2.Temperature:**Row 5 has the lowest temperature (57), possibly reflecting a colder season or location. Row 7 (73) represents a slightly warmer period but still marks the minimum temperature in that context.\n\n**3.Wind:** The lowest wind speed is found in row 8 (2.3), likely due to calm conditions, while row 6 (8) shows stronger winds, possibly due to more open areas or seasonal wind patterns.\n\n**These findings point to cooler, calmer, and less sunny conditions in specific months or locations, affected by seasonal or environmental factors.**\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(403).png)\n\n![](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Samuel/Screenshot%20(397).png)\n\n##### Pivot Table 3: Maximum Levels of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature by Month\n\n**1. Solar Radiation:** The highest solar radiation is in row 5 (334), followed closely by row 6 (323). This suggests that these months or locations receive the most sunlight, likely due to clearer skies or longer daylight hours.
