# Weekly Updates

## Week 1 (August 26 \~ August 30)

No updates yet! Everyone's started working on their data sets.

### Notes from Chris on Monday (Aug 26)

Our first task is going to be to create a documentation on the data sets that we have chosen. Let's work on getting information on the data, the formats it's available in, the data represented, the data points collected, and even the extent of data provided in each of the sets.


#### Chris' Update

* Excel Unit 1 tasks
  + Worked on the Excel unit with the airquality_datasets.csv file, and followed the suggested steps
    - ![Step 1 - Highlighting NA Values using conditional formatting](excel_unit_1_screenshot_1_AirQuality_Step1.png)
    - ![Step 2 - Filtering out NA values for Ozone and Day columns](excel_unit_1_screenshot_1_AirQuality_Step2.png)
    - ![Step 3 - Creating a scatter plot of Ozone vs Day](excel_unit_1_screenshot_1_AirQuality_Step3.png)
  + Applied the steps to another dataset, the diamonds_ggplot2.csv set.
    - ![Step 1 - Loaded the CSV onto excel and examined the rows and columns](VIZ_step1.png)
    - The Diamonds dataset defines the different characteristics of a diamond namely, carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, price, and lengths in the x, y, and z direction
      The dataset itself did not have any NA values, and hence did not need any additional steps for cleaning the data.
      An interesting observation to be made was that there are several interesting correlations between the columns that can help us observe some basic trends in the diamond trading business. There were more than 53,000 records collected, and so this dataset is very comprehensive!
      I planned on using the dataset to compare the cut of a diamond against the price of the diamond, thus showing us the most premium or sought after diamonds and the range at which they are sold.
      ![Step 2 - Selecting the appropriate columns - Cut and Price](VIZ_step2.png)
    - Next, I created different charts to visualize the data. I started with the scatter plot.
      ![Scatter Plot of Diamonds](VIZ_scatter_plot.png)
      ![Bar chart of Diamonds (Price vs Carat)](VIZ_bar_chart.png)
      ![Bar chart of Diamonds (Carat vs Price)](VIZ_bar_chart2.png)
      ![Pie chart of Diamonds](VIZ_pie_chart.png)
    - Given the size of the dataset, I decided to only use 150 records to determine correlations as an exmaple. 
    - When trying to create more visualizations, I observed that not all charts were capable of visualizing this data, and furthermore, given the size of the dataset, all operations were much slower on the online excel sheet.
    - I believe the best visualization for such data is the Bar Chart of Price vs Carats, because it captures the inherent reality that more carats means more price.
  + All in all, it was an interesting start to the class and helped me better understand how visualizations can be achieved on excel.
