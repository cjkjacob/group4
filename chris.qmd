#### Diamonds Dataset

I applied the learnings and findings from the Excel Unit to another dataset, the diamonds_ggplot2.csv set.
  - ![Step 1 - Loaded the CSV onto excel and examined the rows and columns](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/VIZ_step1.png){.lightbox}
  - The Diamonds dataset defines the different characteristics of a diamond namely, carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, price, and lengths in the x, y, and z direction
      The dataset itself did not have any NA values, and hence did not need any additional steps for cleaning the data.
      An interesting observation to be made was that there are several interesting correlations between the columns that can help us observe some basic trends in the diamond trading business. There were more than 53,000 records collected, and so this dataset is very comprehensive!

##### Preparing the dataset

Considering the size of the dataset, I had to use 500 random records to create my visualizations. Here's a step by step guide on how I did that.

###### Add a random number column
- Choose a column and add the RAND() function to the column. Double click on the bottom right of the cell to paste the function to the rest of the rows in the dataset. This creates a random number between 0 and 1. ![Added Random Number COlumn](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/random_number_column.png){.lightbox}
- Next, we apply a filter to the entire dataset, and use the random number column (sorting it from smallest to largest). This automatically rearranges the data records, making the first 500 random. ![Filter for randomness](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/filter_for_randomness.png){.lightbox} 
- Copy the first 500 records to a new sheet. This now becomes your 500 records that give you a true random overview of the Diamonds dataset. ![New Sheet with random values](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/new_sheet_with_random_values.png){.lightbox}
- Since the records didn't contain any NA values, this looked like the only preparation I needed to do.

###### Creating visualizations

####### Scatter Plot: Carat VS Price

- The first plot I created was a scatter plot that visualized the relationship between the carat of the diamond and the price it would sell at
![Carat VS Price Scatter Plot](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/scatter_carat_vs_price.png){.lightbox}
- From this, we can see that the dimaonds that have a higher carat sell for more.

####### Histogram: Sum of Price by Color
- The next plot I created was a histogram that visualized the relationship between the prices and the color of the diamond.
![Sum of Price by Color](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/histogram_price_color.png){.lightbox}

- From this chart, it was clear to see that the diamonds that had the most value were those with the 'H' coloration.

####### Other charts
- When trying to create more visualizations, I observed that not all charts were capable of visualizing this data, and furthermore, given the size of the dataset, all operations were much slower on the online excel sheet.
- I believe the best visualization for such data is the Scatter Plot of Price vs Carats, because it captures the inherent reality that more carats means more price.
All in all, it was an interesting start to the class and helped me better understand how visualizations can be achieved on excel.

#### NCES Education Dataset

NCES Education Dataset is extremely vast and includes several different studies conducted over a range of years. Today,  we'll only be focusing the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. You can find out more [here](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/index.asp){target="_blank"}

The High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) is a comprehensive study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It tracks a cohort of students who began 9th grade in 2009, following them through their high school years and beyond into postsecondary education and the workforce. The study focuses on students' educational trajectories, especially in STEM, examining factors like course-taking patterns, college aspirations, and career choices. The data collected provides insights into how high school experiences influence long-term educational and career outcomes. 

##### Working with the datset
- This can be an extremely complicated process. The first step should be to go to [the registration page](https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/membership/register){target="_blank"} and registering yourself to access all the benefits that NCES datalabs offer. ![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/register_new_user_chris_nces.png){.lightbox}
- This gives us access to the data lab dashboard. Since we can't use excel because of the extremely large size, so we'll have to use the datalabs power stats tool for this. ![](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/datalabs_overview.png){.lightbox}

##### Simple Visualization

- Considering that I couldn't use excel for this process, it was interesting to see the amount of data and variables I had at my disposal for this project. For example, just the keyword 'STEM' has 294 variables attached to it. 

- One comparison I made using the PowerStats tool to create a percentage analysis of the relationship between variables S1 and S3.
  - S1 looks into how math teachers make math so easy to understand. This is divided as 'Strongly Agree', 'Agree', 'Neutral', 'Disagree', 'Strongly Disagree'
  - S3 shows how students might consider STEM as a major.
- This visualization further strengthens the premise that teachers are the defining factors in a lot of the future decisions that students make.

![Pecentage Analysis](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/stem_math_visualization.png){.lightbox}

- It further allowed me to use the bar chart to show this information visually.
![Pecentage Analysis](./Excel_1_Unit/Week1_Chris/stem_math_chart.png){.lightbox}


##### Inference

- These visualizations make it clear that teachers who help make concepts like math and science easier to understand, help these students choose STEM as a major in university.
- This insight will further add to the 'STEM Focused' dataset that I'll be building during this semester.

#### Conclusion
- Given the vastness of this dataset, I believe it's important for me to better understand and comprehend this dataset, so that I can fully utilize and appreciate all the data collected. Although I wasn't able to use Excel on this dataset, the skills learned in the previous classes definitely helped set me up for success with this.



## Week 2 - 09/02 ~ 09/06

### Wednesday & Friday

#### Data Analysis & Pivot Techniques

This week, we focused on using **pivot tables** and **pivot charts** on the cleaned dataset from last week, to explore relationships between variables in the dataset. Pivot tables allow for a quick and efficient way to summarize, reorganize, and analyze data without needing to manually group or sort data. They provide insights by aggregating data across categories and displaying results in a table format.

- **Pivot tables**: Help summarize large datasets by grouping them according to key variables, allowing for quick identification of patterns and trends.
- **Pivot charts**: Visual representations of the data in pivot tables. These charts help communicate the relationships and trends identified in the data through pivot analysis.

Using these tools, we were able to gain deeper insights into the environmental data from the airquality dataset. Key relationships between temperature, wind speed, ozone concentration, and solar radiation were analyzed, leading to findings that provided a better understanding of weather and air quality trends.

#### Context of the AirQuality Dataset

The **airquality.csv** dataset is a popular dataset that contains information about New York's air quality measurements recorded in the year 1973. It consists of daily readings of various air quality parameters such as ozone concentration, solar radiation, wind speed, and temperature. 

##### Key Variables:
- **Ozone**: The concentration of ozone in parts per billion (ppb).
- **Solar.R**: Solar radiation in langleys.
- **Wind**: Wind speed in miles per hour.
- **Temp**: Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
- **Month**: The month during which the data was recorded (from May to September).
- **Day**: The day of the month.

This dataset provides valuable insights into how different environmental factors interact over time and can be used to analyze trends related to air pollution and weather patterns.


#### Quick Recap of Data Preprocessing

##### Download data

I downloaded a fresh version of the airquality.csv file, and then saved it as a .xlsx file to then manipulate using Excel.

![New Download of airquality.csv](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_new_download.png){.lightbox}

##### Clean Data

Since it was a fresh download of the file, we needed to clean the data of any NA values. Here is a high-level overview of the steps we take to achieve this:

  - **Step 1**: Apply a filter to the data
    ![Filter applied to dataset](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_filter_applied.png){.lightbox}
  
  - **Step 2**: Filter for all NA data in a column (in this case, Ozone)
    ![NA Rows Filtered](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_na_filter_applied.png){.lightbox}

  - **Step 3**: Delete all the rows with an NA value
    ![Deleting NA Rows](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_delete_row_of_na.png){.lightbox}

  - **Step 4**: Repeat for any other columns with NA values
    ![Repeating for Solar Radiation Column](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_repeat_na_solar.png){.lightbox}
  
Now we have a clean dataset that we can use to create pivot tables and pivot charts.


#### Pivot Tables and Insights

##### Creating a genearl pivot table

  - To create a general pivot table, you first select all the data in your dataset as seen below
    ![Select all data in dataset](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_select_insert_pivot.png){.lightbox}
  
  - You then go to the insert tab and click on **Pivot Table** to insert a pivot table
    ![Insert pivot table](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_insert_pivot_table.png){.lightbox}
  
    Here is where you will specify where you want to insert this new table. As suggested by Dr. V, we'll insert it into a new sheet.
    ![Insert in new sheet](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_insert_pivot_table_2.png){.lightbox}
  
  - The next step is to select the fields you want to use in your pivot table. These fields can either be dragged and dropped or checked and unchecked. As the names of the boxes suggest, you have the option to add a **filter**, to add a **column**, to add a **row**, or to specify what **values** you want to use. An interesting point to note here is that you can **stack rows and columns**, essentially creating a dropdown like effect, making data more manageable and understandable.
    ![Select value fields](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_select_fields.png){.lightbox}
  
  - Go ahead and select the fields as below
    ![Fields for table selected](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_fields_selected.png){.lightbox}
  
  - After the fields have been selected, we now have the option to change the **value field settings**. This means that we can change the kind of data we interpret from the dataset. 
    ![Change value field settings](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_value_field_settings_1.png){.lightbox}
  
    In this example, we're going to change it from the sum to the average values for each field.
    ![Use average instead of sum](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_value_field_settings_2.png){.lightbox}
  
  - As part of 'prettifying' our data, let's decrease the decimal places in our data, to only the 2 decimal places.
    ![Reducing significant figures](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_decrease_decimals.png){.lightbox}
  
  - After some more prettifying, we end up with the following **pivot table**, your first pivot table!
    ![First Pivot Table](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_after_formatting.png){.lightbox}
  
  
  
##### Creating your first pivot chart

  - Now that we have the pivot table, we can create a **pivot chart**. To do this, the first step would be to select your pivot table and click on **Pivot Chart** on the insert tab.
    ![Insert pivot chart](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_insert_pivot_chart.png){.lightbox}

  - We can then select what type of chart we'd like to use. Excel automatically tells you what are possible and what aren't possible.
    ![Select chart type](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_insert_pivot_chart_2.png){.lightbox}
  
  - And after choosing the appropriate chart type, **bar chart** in our case, we have created our first pivot chart. *Congratulations*
    ![First Pivot Chart](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_first_pivot_chart.png){.lightbox}
  
  - Another interesting thing you can do with pivot charts, is that we can apply filters to the rows and columns on the chart itself. 
    ![Pivot chart filtering](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_first_pivot_chart_filtered.png){.lightbox}
  


##### Pivot Chart Variations

Now that we know how to create pivot tables and pivot charts, let's use this knowledge to create comparisons in our dataset to further analyze how these different variables interact with each other.

###### Pivot Chart 1: Average of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Temperature, Wind by Month and Day

- This is the pivot chart we just created. This chart shows us a few general trends. Specifically:
  + **Ozone levels seem to correlate with temperature** where higher temperatures in July and August correspond with higher ozone concentrations.
  + **Solar radiation is also highest in the summer months**, contributing to higher temperatures, but interestingly, ozone concentrations are lower in September despite similar solar radiation levels.
  + **Wind speeds decrease as temperatures rise**, indicating that calmer wind conditions occur during the hotter summer months, potentially allowing pollutants like ozone to accumulate more in the atmosphere.
  
  
  ![Average of Ozone, Solar R., Temp, Wind by Month and Day](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_chart_1.png){.lightbox}
  

###### Pivot Chart 2: Average Temp vs Average Ozone by Month

- This pivot chart looks at the average values of temperature vs the average values of ozone by month. The general understanding this gives us is that:
  + The **ozone concentration increases with rising temperature during the summer months**, particularly in July and August.
  + After peaking in the summer, both temperature and ozone levels decrease in September, though the decline in ozone levels is more pronounced than the drop in temperature.
  + This pattern suggests that while temperature is a significant factor in ozone concentration, **other elements such as sunlight intensity and wind speed might also contribute to the sudden drop in ozone levels** observed in September.
  
  
  ![Pivot table](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_table_2.png){.lightbox}
  
  
  ![Pivot Chart - A trend line on a bar chart](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_chart_2.png){.lightbox}
  

###### Pivot Chart 3: Average Solar Radiation vs Average of Wind speeds by Month

- This pivot chart looks at the average values of solar radiation vs the average values of wind speeds by month. Here are the trends we can observe:
  + There is an **inverse relationship** between solar radiation and wind speed during the summer months. As solar radiation peaks in July, wind speeds drop to their lowest levels. This could be due to **more stable weather conditions with fewer disturbances** (such as storms) that typically bring stronger winds.
  + In the transition months of May and September, the wind speeds are higher, possibly due to more atmospheric variability as seasons change, while solar radiation is moderate.
  + The **decrease in wind speed during the summer may contribute to higher ozone levels observed in earlier analyses**, as calmer winds allow pollutants to accumulate.

  ![Pivot Chart - 2 trend lines with markers with a secondary axis](./Excel_2_Unit/Week_2_Chris/airquality_pivot_chart_3.png){.lightbox}
  

##### **Pivot Chart Conclusion**
- There are several different charts that can be made from this simple dataset, which further demonstrates just how powerful the pivot table and pivot chart features are! 
- Learning how to use this feature is definitely going to be helpful in my future endeavors with data.



### Midterm Project Context

The goal of this midterm project is to analyze data from the **High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)** to explore how early exposure to STEM education affects future career outcomes. The project will focus on:
- How students’ interest in STEM subjects during high school influences their college major and career choices.

#### HSLS Dataset

The **High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)**, launched by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), provides a rich source of data for educational research. By tracking students from the beginning of high school through postsecondary education and into their careers, HSLS:09 offers valuable insights into student pathways, especially in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). 

Let's break down the context of HSLS:09 using the 5 W's framework to better understand its significance.

##### **Who?**
- **Participants:** HSLS:09 initially sampled over **23,000 ninth-grade students** from 944 high schools across the United States. It also collected data from parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators.
- **Demographics:** The participants represented a diverse cross-section of students, varying in socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, and geographic locations.
- **Stakeholders:** Aside from students, the survey data also involves insights from educators and family members, making it a comprehensive longitudinal study.

##### **What?**
- **Scope:** The HSLS:09 focuses on understanding students' educational choices, performance, and postsecondary transitions. One of the study’s unique features is its emphasis on **STEM education and career trajectories**. Cognitive assessments were administered alongside surveys to measure student aptitude in mathematics and science.
- **Data Collected:** The study captures a wide range of data, including academic achievement, **cognitive tests**, postsecondary aspirations, **parental influence**, school characteristics, and career goals.
- **Assessment:** The students underwent math assessments in the ninth grade, and their progress was tracked through **follow-up surveys** in 2012, 2016, and beyond.

##### **Where?**
- **Geographic Coverage:** The survey covered high schools throughout the United States, including urban, suburban, and rural areas. This allowed for a broad understanding of educational experiences across different geographic and socioeconomic environments.
- **Postsecondary Transitions:** The follow-up surveys track students as they transition into a variety of postsecondary environments, including two- and four-year colleges, vocational programs, and directly into the workforce.

##### **When?**
- **Initial Data Collection:** The study began in 2009 when the participants were in ninth grade. Subsequent data collection points occurred in **2012, 2013, 2016**, and more recently, following students through their postsecondary education and career entry phases.
- **Longitudinal Approach:** HSLS:09 is designed to track participants over an extended period, providing insights into the long-term effects of high school experiences on educational attainment and career success.

##### **Why?**
- **STEM Emphasis:** A primary goal of HSLS:09 is to understand how high school experiences, especially in STEM fields, influence later educational and career outcomes. The study explores what motivates students to pursue careers in STEM and what barriers may exist, such as socioeconomic factors or lack of resources.
- **Educational Equity:** Another key objective is to assess **educational equity**. HSLS:09 allows researchers to examine disparities in student experiences based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location, providing a wealth of information for policymakers.
- **Policy Implications:** The data serves as a foundation for designing interventions that can address gaps in education, particularly for underrepresented groups in STEM.

##### **How?**

The data gathered from this study can be used to develop strategies that support student success, particularly in underrepresented communities. For this midterm project, analyzing this dataset allows us to explore key questions about educational pathways, parental influence, and career readiness, providing a solid foundation for research in educational policy and student development.


## Week 3 - 09/09 ~ 09/13

### Wednesday

I decided to use the **Violent Crime Rates by US State**, otherwise known as the USArrests dataset. Here's some key information about the USArrests dataset.

#### Description

This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

#### Format

A data frame with 50 observations on 4 variables.

1. Murder	numeric	Murder arrests (per 100,000)
2. Assault	numeric	Assault arrests (per 100,000)
3. UrbanPop	numeric	Percent urban population
4. Rape	numeric	Rape arrests (per 100,000)

#### Notes

USArrests contains the data as in McNeil's monograph. For the UrbanPop percentages, a review of the table (No. 21) in the Statistical Abstracts 1975 reveals a transcription error for Maryland (and that McNeil used the same “round to even” rule that R's round() uses), as found by Daniel S Coven (Arizona).

#### Source

World Almanac and Book of facts 1975. (Crime rates).

Statistical Abstracts of the United States 1975, p.20, (Urban rates), possibly available as <https://books.google.ch/books?id=zl9qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA20>

#### References

McNeil, D. R. (1977) Interactive Data Analysis. New York: Wiley.

#### Tableau Dashboard

This is the dashboard created for the USArrests dataset on tableau. Tableau was fairly easy to use and the USArrests dataset was easy to import and implement.

```

Here's some insights from the tableau dashboard

##### Comparison of Variables - Observations

![Comparison of Variables](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/comparison_of_variables_chart.png){.lightbox}

###### Key Insights from the Chart:

- **Urban Population Dominates:**
  - The urban population (represented in teal) is significantly higher compared to the crime-related measures (murder, rape, and assault) in all states.
  - States like California, Florida, and New York have noticeably high urban populations, reflecting their dense urban areas.

- **Assault is the Most Prominent Crime:**
  - Among the crime-related variables, assault (in blue) has the highest values across most states compared to murder and rape.
  - States like California, Florida, and Texas show higher assault rates than smaller or less populated states.

- **Murder and Rape Trends:**
  - Murder (red) and rape (green) have lower values compared to assault.
  - Certain states, such as Texas and Florida, show moderate increases in both murder and rape rates compared to other states.

- **State Comparisons:**
  - New York, California, Texas, and Florida are outliers in terms of high urban population and assault rates, while smaller states like Rhode Island, Vermont, and North Dakota have much lower values across all variables.

- **General Trends:**
  - In general, states with larger urban populations tend to have higher crime rates, particularly assaults. However, the murder and rape rates don't show as sharp an increase, suggesting that assault is more widely reported or prevalent compared to murder and rape in many states.

###### Overall Observations:

- **Urbanization and Crime:** 
  - There's a clear pattern showing that states with larger urban populations also tend to report higher crime rates, especially assault. This could be due to factors like higher population density, socioeconomic conditions, or more effective reporting mechanisms.

- **Assault:** 
  - The prominence of assault across all states suggests it may be the most common form of violent crime, while murder and rape remain lower.
  
##### Murder & Assault Comparison - Observations

![Murder VS Assault Comparison](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/murder_vs_assault_chart.png){.lightbox}


###### Key Observations:

- **Top States with High Assault and Murder Rates:**
  - Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, and Arizona are at the top of the list, indicating that these states have the highest combined average rates of murder and assault.
  - These states likely face a combination of socioeconomic factors, larger urban populations, or more prevalent crime, resulting in higher overall violent crime rates.

- **Mid-Ranking States:**
  - States like California, Mississippi, Alaska, Michigan, New York, Louisiana, and Nevada fall in the middle range of the rankings. These states still have higher than average violent crime rates but are not at the extreme end like Florida or North Carolina.
  - The presence of larger states like California and New York here suggests that while they are populous and urbanized, their combined violent crime rates are relatively controlled when compared to states like Florida.

- **Lower Crime Rate States:**
  - Iowa, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Vermont, and North Dakota rank at the bottom of the chart, indicating significantly lower combined rates of murder and assault.
  - States like Vermont and North Dakota are typically less populated and more rural, which may contribute to their lower violent crime rates. This suggests that crime in these states may be less of a social concern.

- **State-wise Trends:**
  - Southern and Eastern states like Florida, North Carolina, and Maryland tend to have higher violent crime rates, as opposed to Midwestern and Northern states like North Dakota, Vermont, and Minnesota, which generally report lower rates.
  - This pattern could reflect regional socioeconomic disparities, population density, or differences in law enforcement efficacy.

- **General Trend:**
  - States with larger urban populations and economic challenges seem to rank higher on the combined assault and murder rates.
  - On the other hand, smaller, more rural states with lower population densities have less violent crime overall.

###### Conclusion:

- Florida stands out as the state with the highest combined average of murder and assault rates, potentially indicating broader societal challenges in terms of violence and crime control.
- The Southern and Eastern U.S. regions tend to show higher violent crime rates, whereas Midwestern and Northern regions demonstrate much lower combined murder and assault rates.
- State size and urbanization do not necessarily guarantee higher crime rates, as demonstrated by California and New York's middle placement in the chart.

This chart provides a comprehensive view of how different U.S. states compare in terms of violent crime rates, offering valuable insights into which regions face more crime-related challenges and which regions enjoy greater safety.

##### Assault VS Crime Comparisons - Observations

![Assault VS Crime](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/assault_vs_crime.png){.lightbox}


###### Breakdown and Insights:

1. **Assault vs Murder (Left Plot - Green)**
   - **Trend:** There is a positive correlation between murder rates and assault rates. States with higher murder rates also tend to have higher assault rates. The points generally follow an upward trend as the murder rate increases.
   - **Outliers:** Some states, however, have relatively high assault rates but lower murder rates, and vice versa. This could indicate differences in the nature of violent crimes across certain states.
   - **Key Insight:** States with higher murder rates are more likely to experience higher assault rates as well, reflecting an overall violent crime environment.

2. **Assault vs Rape (Middle Plot - Red)**
   - **Trend:** There is also a positive correlation between assault and rape, although it appears less consistent than the correlation between murder and assault.
   - **Variation:** Some states have very high rape rates but relatively lower assault rates and vice versa. This suggests that these two types of violent crime might not always overlap to the same extent.
   - **Key Insight:** While there is some correlation between rape and assault rates, the variation suggests that states may experience different patterns in the prevalence of these two crimes.

3. **Assault vs Urban Population (Right Plot - Blue)**
   - **Trend:** As expected, there is a positive correlation between the size of the urban population and assault rates. More densely populated states or those with large urban centers tend to report higher assault rates.
   - **Key Insight:** Urbanization plays a significant role in the prevalence of assault crimes. States with larger urban populations often face more challenges related to violent crimes like assault.

###### General Observations:

- **Overall Correlation:** Assault seems to correlate positively with other violent crimes (murder and rape), but the strongest relationship is with murder rates.
- **Urbanization Impact:** The third plot clearly demonstrates that higher urban populations are associated with higher assault rates, indicating that population density could be a major contributing factor to crime rates.

This chart provides a detailed look at how assault correlates with murder, rape, and urban population, showing that violent crimes tend to increase together, especially in more urbanized areas.

##### High Crime VS Low Crime Observations

![High vs Low Crime](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/high_low_crime_chart.png){.lightbox}

###### Key Insights:

- **States with Predominantly High Crime Rates:**
  - States like Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, and Florida show high overall crime severity (with larger blue bars), indicating that these states tend to experience more severe crime issues.
  - In these states, the high crime rates dominate, suggesting that these states might face significant challenges in curbing violent or severe crimes.

- **States with Balanced Crime Severity:**
  - Some states, such as Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, and Maine, show a more balanced distribution between high and low crime severity. The orange and blue bars are more evenly distributed, suggesting a mix of both high and low severity crimes.
  - This could indicate that while these states experience some severe crimes, they also have a significant portion of lower-severity crimes, perhaps petty crimes or less violent offenses.

- **States with Predominantly Low Crime Rates:**
  - States like Nebraska, Vermont, and Wyoming show higher low-crime severity (with larger orange bars), indicating that these states experience fewer high-severity crimes. The majority of crimes in these states are less severe, suggesting generally safer environments.
  - These states may prioritize law enforcement for less severe crimes or have social factors that mitigate more violent crimes.

- **Regional Trends:**
  - Southern states such as Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi show higher overall crime severity, with high crime significantly outweighing low crime.
  - Northern and Midwestern states like Minnesota, Michigan, and Vermont seem to have much lower crime severity, especially in terms of high-severity crimes.

- **Total Crime Severity:**
  - States like California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas stand out for having relatively high overall crime severity, with significant portions of both high and low crime. These states have large populations, which might account for the overall crime volume.
  - Vermont and Wyoming, on the other hand, show the lowest overall crime severity, indicating these states are among the safest in the country in terms of crime levels.

###### General Observations:

- **High vs. Low Crime Split:** The split between high and low crime provides a clear comparison of the types of crimes affecting each state. States with a larger high crime bar indicate more severe criminal issues, whereas those with larger low crime bars may experience primarily less serious offenses.
- **Outliers:** Some states, like Florida and Illinois, show both high levels of crime severity across the board, indicating that while they face challenges with serious crime, they also have a substantial amount of less severe crime.

This chart provides a comprehensive look at how crime severity varies across states, giving a clearer picture of the types of crimes that dominate in different regions.

#### Conclusion

##### Key Conclusions Based on Crime Trends and Patterns Across U.S. States:

1. **Correlation Between Different Violent Crimes:**
   - Across all charts, there is a consistent positive correlation between different types of violent crimes, especially between murder and assault. States with higher rates of one violent crime tend to have higher rates of others.
   - **Assault** emerges as a dominant crime in most states, correlating strongly with other violent crimes such as murder and rape. This suggests that regions facing assault issues may also struggle with broader violent crime challenges.

2. **Urbanization and Crime:**
   - There is a clear link between urban population size and higher crime rates, particularly with assault. States with larger urban populations tend to report more violent crimes. This trend is evident in the scatter plots comparing assault rates to urban population size.
   - States like **Florida, California, and Texas**, with their large urban centers, display both higher overall crime severity and more violent crime rates. This highlights the challenges faced by densely populated states in controlling violent crime.

3. **High and Low Crime Severity:**
   - Certain states, like **Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina**, consistently rank high in both violent crime rates and crime severity, indicating significant challenges in addressing both high- and low-severity crimes.
   - Conversely, states like **Vermont, Wyoming, and North Dakota** show very low crime severity and lower violent crime rates overall, suggesting safer environments with fewer serious criminal offenses.

4. **Regional Crime Trends:**
   - **Southern and Western states** tend to face greater crime challenges, particularly with violent crimes like assault and murder. These regions often rank higher in both crime rates and severity.
   - **Midwestern and Northern states** such as Vermont, Iowa, and Minnesota typically report lower violent crime rates and severity, suggesting that these areas may benefit from a combination of social stability, effective law enforcement, or less urbanization.

##### Final Conclusion:

States with larger urban populations, especially in the South and West, experience higher crime rates, particularly violent crimes like assault and murder. **Assault** is a prevalent issue, often correlating with other violent crimes, and more densely populated states tend to face higher crime severity overall. On the other hand, more rural or less densely populated states, especially in the Midwest and North, experience fewer violent crimes and lower crime severity, making them generally safer.

This analysis highlights the significant role that **urbanization**, **regional differences**, and **socio-economic factors** play in shaping crime patterns across the U.S.


### Friday

Working off of the NCES data, here's an overview of the dataset.

##### Dataset - HSLS Data

The dataset is drawn from the **High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)**, which tracks a cohort of students who entered 9th grade in the fall of 2009. The study captures detailed data on students' academic achievements, interests, attitudes, and family and school characteristics, with a particular focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields. The dataset includes measures on math and science performance, parental occupation, student demographics, and self-reported attitudes towards STEM subjects.

```{=html}
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1726478948373' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;NC&#47;NCES_Data&#47;Dashboard&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='NCES_Data&#47;Dashboard' /><param name='tabs' value='yes' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;NC&#47;NCES_Data&#47;Dashboard&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1726478948373');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.minHeight='1850px';vizElement.style.maxHeight=(divElement.offsetWidth*1.77)+'px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

```

##### Student Sex VS Parent STEM Occupation Visualization

![Student Sex VS Parent STEM Occupation](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/parent_vs_stem_chart_1.png){.lightbox}

This visualization illustrates the relationship between the gender of students and the type of STEM occupation their parents have. Below are the key insights derived from the visualization:

###### Key Insights:

- **Parent Occupation Type 0 Dominates:**
  - The majority of students have parents in **Occupation Type 0**, where most data points are concentrated.
  - Within this category, there is a significant count of both male and female students (represented by different shades of brown and orange), with a relatively balanced distribution between genders.

- **Sparse Representation in Other Occupation Types:**
  - For **Occupation Types 4 and 5**, there is a much smaller number of students, indicating that fewer parents in these categories work in STEM occupations.
  - The counts are notably lower, especially when compared to Occupation Type 0.

- **Gender Distribution:**
  - The gender distribution appears relatively even in the dominant category (**Occupation Type 0**). However, as we move to other occupation types, the data becomes sparser, making it harder to discern strong gender-based trends.
  - In **Occupation Type 4**, there seems to be a slight skew towards male students, although the sample size is relatively small.

- **Implications for Parent Influence:**
  - The strong presence of students associated with **Parent Occupation Type 0** suggests that most students have parents who may not be specifically involved in STEM occupations or belong to a general category that includes STEM-adjacent roles.
  - The smaller representation in other occupation types might indicate that parents in more specialized STEM roles have fewer children, or those children are underrepresented in this dataset.

###### Conclusion:

This visualization highlights the strong influence of parents in **Occupation Type 0** on students, regardless of gender. There is a relatively balanced gender representation in this dominant category, but in the smaller STEM-specific occupation categories, there are fewer students overall. This could point to either a lack of representation in STEM fields for certain types of occupations or simply fewer parents in these roles.

##### Race VS Math Score Visualization

![Race VS Math Score](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/race_vs_math_chart_2.png){.lightbox}


In this visualization, we analyze the performance of various racial groups on their average math scores using the provided race categories. Here's the breakdown based on the race list:

###### Insights:

- **Race 4 (Hispanic, no race specified):**
  - Hispanic (no race specified) students show the most significant negative deviation, with an average math score well below zero. This indicates that this group is underperforming significantly in math compared to others.
  - The drop in math scores for this group may highlight educational or socioeconomic disparities affecting their performance.

- **Race 2 (Asian, non-Hispanic):**
  - Asian, non-Hispanic students are performing slightly above average in math. This group shows a small positive deviation, indicating that they are outperforming other racial groups on average.
  - This aligns with general trends observed in educational datasets where Asian students often excel in math-related subjects.

- **Race 3 (Black/African-American, non-Hispanic):**
  - Black/African-American, non-Hispanic students show a small negative deviation from the average. While they underperform in math compared to other racial groups, the deviation is not as drastic as the Hispanic (no race specified) group.
  - This performance may reflect challenges related to access to resources, educational opportunities, or broader social factors.

- **Race 8 (White, non-Hispanic):**
  - White, non-Hispanic students show minimal deviation from the average math score, suggesting that their performance is close to the overall mean.
  - This indicates that White, non-Hispanic students are generally performing at or around the national average in math.

- **Race 5 (Hispanic, race specified):**
  - There are fewer significant trends for Race 5, but there may be a smaller negative deviation for Hispanic students whose race is specified.
  - This suggests that while both groups of Hispanic students (Race 4 and 5) underperform, those with a specified race perform slightly better than those with an unspecified race.

###### General Observations:

- **Hispanic Students (Race 4)** are struggling the most with math performance, while **Asian Students (Race 2)** show the best results, performing above average.
- **Black/African-American students (Race 3)** perform slightly below average, while **White students (Race 8)** remain close to the average performance.
- The visualization highlights racial disparities in math education and suggests potential areas for further investigation, such as how socio-economic status or educational resources may impact these differences.

###### Conclusion:

This analysis sheds light on how different racial groups perform in math and suggests that targeted interventions may be needed to address the performance gap, particularly for **Hispanic students**. 


##### Parent Education Level VS STEM Interest (Math & Science) Visualization

![Parent Education Level VS STEM Interest (Math)](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/math_interest_vs_parent_education_chart3.png){.lightbox}


![Parent Education Level VS STEM Interest (Science)](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/science_interest_vs_parent_education_chart4.png){.lightbox}

This analysis focuses on two scatter plot visualizations: **Math Interest** and **Science Interest**. Each visualization shows the relationship between students’ interest in STEM subjects (math and science) and their parent’s highest level of education.

###### Parent Education Levels:
- **1:** Less than high school
- **2:** High school diploma or GED
- **3:** Associate's degree
- **4:** Bachelor's degree
- **5:** Master's degree
- **7:** Ph.D./M.D./Law/Other high-level professional degree

###### Math Interest:

In the first visualization, the vertical axis represents the calculated/standardized **interest in math**, while the horizontal axis shows the parent’s highest level of education. Higher values on the vertical axis represent greater interest in math.

- Key Insights:

- **Concentration Around GED and Bachelor’s Degree (Levels 2 and 4):**
  - There is a notable concentration of data points at education levels **2** (high school diploma or GED) and **4** (bachelor's degree), suggesting that most students with parents at these education levels show a range of math interest values.
  - The majority of the data points are spread between -0.5 and +0.5, suggesting **average math interest**, regardless of parental education level for these categories.

- **Outliers in PhD/Professional Degree (Level 7):**
  - A few outliers show extremely high interest in math among students whose parents have achieved higher professional degrees (level 7). This indicates that students with highly educated parents may show **greater interest** in math.
  - However, there are also students in this category with **negative math interest**, indicating that parent education alone may not be a definitive predictor of math interest.

- **Overall Spread:**
  - Most students fall between -1 to +1 on the math interest scale, with no dramatic spikes or drops. The relationship between parent education and math interest appears **moderate**, but students with higher-educated parents (levels 4-7) show **more positive trends**.

###### Science Interest:

In the second visualization, the vertical axis represents **science interest**, and the horizontal axis shows parent education levels. The structure is similar to the math interest plot, with higher values representing greater interest in science.

- Key Insights:

- **Broad Spread of Interest:**
  - The **science interest** values show a broader distribution compared to math, with many students clustered between -0.5 to 0.5, but also some outliers reaching up to +2.
  - Similar to math interest, parent education levels **2** (GED) and **4** (bachelor's degree) dominate in terms of data points.

- **More Positive Interest for Higher Parent Education:**
  - Students with parents holding higher degrees (**levels 4-7**) generally display **positive science interest**. Many fall near the average, but there is a cluster of students with significantly higher interest.
  - Students with parents holding **Ph.D. or professional degrees (level 7)** also show a range of interest, with some outliers exhibiting **higher science interest**.

- **Less Impact for Lower Education Levels:**
  - The lower education levels (**1 to 3**) have fewer students with high interest in science. The interest levels tend to hover around the zero mark, suggesting **neutral or average interest** in science.

###### General Observations:

- **Higher parental education (levels 4-7)** tends to correlate with slightly **increased interest** in both math and science, particularly for students whose parents hold bachelor's degrees or higher.
- While there is a concentration of **average interest** in both subjects, the presence of outliers shows that highly educated parents may foster greater interest in STEM.
- **Lower education levels (1 to 3)** correspond with more **neutral or average interest** in both subjects. There isn’t a dramatic decline in interest among students from these education backgrounds, but the positive trend is more prominent among higher-educated parents.

###### Conclusion:

The scatter plots show a moderate but positive relationship between parent education levels and student interest in STEM fields. Higher parental education levels are associated with greater interest in math and science, particularly for parents holding bachelor's degrees or higher. However, the data also suggests that parent education level alone is not the sole determinant of student interest in STEM.


##### Family Income VS Math Proficiency Visualization

![Family Income VS Math Proficiency](./Tableau_Unit/Week_3_Chris/family_income_vs_math_proficiency.png){.lightbox}


This analysis focuses on the relationship between **family income** and **math proficiency** using a treemap. Below are insights based on the income categories provided.

- **Race’s Impact:** Race plays a more crucial role, with White and Asian students showing higher math self-efficacy, while Hispanic students often show lower confidence.
- **Challenges Remain:** While gender stereotypes around math may be weakening, racial disparities in self-efficacy still present a challenge, impacting how students view their ability to succeed in math.

###### 5. Parent STEM Occupation Influence on Student Gender:
- **No Major Gender Difference:** There is no significant gender difference in student representation across parental STEM occupations. However, there are fewer students overall with parents working in STEM fields.
- **Broader Societal Influences:** The influence of a parent’s STEM occupation appears to be less significant regarding gender representation, suggesting that other factors—such as societal influences—may play a more dominant role in shaping STEM career aspirations.

###### Holistic Observations:
Across the board, these visualizations reveal that **socioeconomic status** and **race** are the most influential factors shaping math performance, STEM interest, and self-efficacy among students. While parental education and income provide advantages, it is clear that racial inequities in education still present significant barriers to success, particularly for Hispanic and Black students.

**Gender** appears to have less of an impact on math outcomes compared to race and socioeconomic factors, as both male and female students demonstrate similar levels of math self-efficacy and interest in STEM fields.

###### Recommendations for Educational Improvement:

- **Targeted Support for Lower-Income and Underrepresented Students:**
  - Access to tutoring, educational resources, and extracurricular STEM programs should be increased, particularly for students from lower-income families and racial groups that tend to underperform.

- **Mentorship and Role Models:**
  - Providing mentorship and exposure to role models from similar racial and socioeconomic backgrounds in STEM fields can help boost self-efficacy and interest in math and science.

- **Parental Engagement and Support:**
  - Encouraging parental involvement and education programs for parents with lower educational attainment could help increase their children's engagement and interest in math and STEM.

- **Addressing Systemic Barriers:**
  - Schools and policymakers should continue to address systemic inequalities in education that disproportionately affect minority students, ensuring equal access to high-quality education and resources for all.

###### Final Thoughts:
This comprehensive analysis emphasizes the need for systemic changes to level the playing field, ensuring that factors such as **income** and **race** no longer determine a student's success in math and STEM fields.

![Distribution of Ozone Levels](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_files/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_7_0.png){.lightbox}


The histogram visualizes the distribution of ozone levels (in parts per billion - ppb) from the dataset.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Skewed Distribution:**
   - The distribution of ozone levels is **right-skewed**. Most of the data points fall in the lower ozone ranges, particularly between **0 and 50 ppb**.
   - There are fewer data points with higher ozone levels, with a long tail extending toward **175 ppb**.

2. **High Frequency in Low Ozone Levels:**
   - The highest frequency of ozone levels is concentrated between **0 and 25 ppb**, where more than **20 occurrences** are recorded.
   - This suggests that lower ozone levels are more common in the dataset.

3. **Moderate Levels Between 25 and 50 ppb:**
   - There is a significant drop in frequency between **25 and 50 ppb**, with frequencies ranging between **10 to 15 occurrences**.
   - These levels are still relatively common but less so than the lowest ozone levels.

4. **Low Frequency of High Ozone Levels:**
   - Ozone levels greater than **50 ppb** occur much less frequently.
   - Between **50 and 100 ppb**, there are scattered occurrences, with frequencies generally **below 10**.
   - Beyond **100 ppb**, the frequencies drop dramatically, with very few data points between **100 and 175 ppb**.

5. **Outliers in High Ozone Levels:**
   - There are a few outliers with ozone levels exceeding **150 ppb**, but these are rare occurrences, indicating that extremely high ozone levels are uncommon in this dataset.

###### General Trends:

- The data shows that **low ozone levels** dominate, while **higher ozone levels** are rare.
- This type of distribution might reflect **air quality** patterns in the region where the data was collected, suggesting that **low ozone** is the norm, with fewer instances of high ozone pollution.

###### Conclusion:

The histogram reveals that ozone levels are predominantly low, with a clear skew toward the lower end of the spectrum. The **right-skew** suggests that high ozone levels are infrequent, possibly indicating generally better air quality in the region of interest.

plt.show()
```


    
![Distribution of Temperature](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_files/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_8_0.png){.lightbox}
    
This histogram visualizes the distribution of **temperature (in °F)** from the dataset.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Normal Distribution with Slight Skew:**
   - The distribution of temperatures appears to have a **normal distribution** with a slight right skew. The temperatures are mostly concentrated between **60°F and 90°F**.
   - The peak temperature occurs around **80°F**, with the highest frequency of over **20 occurrences**.

2. **High Frequency at 80°F:**
   - The highest frequency is at **80°F**, where over **20 occurrences** are recorded. This indicates that **80°F** is a commonly observed temperature in the dataset.

3. **Balanced Spread Between 60°F and 90°F:**
   - Temperatures ranging from **60°F to 90°F** are well represented, with a fairly **even spread**. Most temperatures in this range occur with moderate frequencies between **5 and 15 occurrences**.
   - The distribution suggests that the temperature tends to fluctuate within this range, without extreme lows or highs.

4. **Low Frequency Below 60°F and Above 90°F:**
   - There are fewer occurrences of temperatures below **60°F** and above **90°F**. These extremes are less common, and the dataset is largely concentrated within the **60°F to 90°F range**.
   - The tail at the lower end (< 60°F) suggests that **colder temperatures** are less frequent in this dataset.

5. **Outliers at Low and High Temperatures:**
   - The lower and higher temperature extremes (below **60°F** and above **90°F**) are outliers in the dataset, as they occur with much lower frequency. This suggests that these temperatures are unusual in the context of this dataset.

###### General Trends:

- The dataset shows that **temperatures between 70°F and 80°F** are the most common, with **80°F** being the peak.
- Both **lower temperatures (< 60°F)** and **higher temperatures (> 90°F)** are uncommon, indicating that most temperature observations fall within a moderate range.

###### Conclusion:

The temperature distribution in this dataset follows a fairly **normal pattern**, with a clear peak around **80°F**. The histogram suggests that temperatures typically range between **60°F and 90°F**, with a relatively **low frequency** of extreme temperatures. This distribution may indicate a **moderate climate** in the region where the data was collected.


##### Boxplot of Ozone Levels

```python
# Boxplot for Ozone
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.boxplot(airquality_df['Ozone'].dropna())
plt.title('Boxplot of Ozone Levels')
plt.ylabel('Ozone (ppb)')
plt.show()
```


![Boxplot of Ozone Levels](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_files/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_9_0.png){.lightbox}
    

This boxplot provides a summary of the distribution of **ozone levels** (in ppb - parts per billion), highlighting key statistics such as the median, interquartile range (IQR), and potential outliers.

###### Key Insights:

  1. **Median and Interquartile Range (IQR):**
   - The **median ozone level** is around **25 ppb**, as indicated by the orange line inside the box.
   - The **IQR** (the box) ranges from **approximately 20 ppb to 70 ppb**, meaning that **50% of the data** falls within this range.

:::{.callout-note}
**IQR**, or **Interquartile Range**, is a measure of statistical dispersion and is used to describe the spread of data. It indicates the range within which the **middle 50%** of values in a dataset fall.
:::

   - The lower quartile is just above **20 ppb**, and the upper quartile is around **70 ppb**, showing where the middle half of the ozone levels lie.

2. **Whiskers and Data Spread:**
   - The **lower whisker** extends down to around **5 ppb**, suggesting that the lowest ozone levels in the dataset are close to zero.
   - The **upper whisker** extends to about **125 ppb**, indicating the highest ozone levels within the normal range (excluding outliers).
   - This spread indicates that the ozone levels vary widely, with most values lying between **5 ppb and 125 ppb**.

3. **Outliers:**
   - There are **two outliers** above the upper whisker, with values around **150 ppb** and **175 ppb**. These represent unusual, high ozone levels that are not common in the dataset.
   - The presence of these outliers suggests that while most ozone readings are moderate, there are some instances of much higher ozone levels.

4. **Symmetry of the Distribution:**
   - The distribution appears to be **slightly right-skewed**, as the upper whisker is longer than the lower whisker and there are high-value outliers.
   - This implies that while most ozone levels are concentrated at lower values, there are occasional higher levels.

###### General Trends:

- **Moderate Ozone Levels:** The data shows that most ozone levels fall between **20 and 70 ppb**, with a median of about **25 ppb**, suggesting that moderate ozone levels are the norm.
- **Outliers Indicating High Ozone Events:** The outliers above **150 ppb** indicate that there are occasional **high ozone events**, which could be of interest for further investigation (e.g., environmental factors causing ozone spikes).

###### Conclusion:

The boxplot of ozone levels reveals that the distribution is **slightly skewed to the right**, with most values falling between **20 and 70 ppb**. The **median** is around **25 ppb**, and there are **two notable outliers** with much higher ozone levels, pointing to occasional extreme events. This provides a useful overview of ozone concentration variability and the presence of high-level ozone outliers in the dataset.

##### Scatter plot of Temperature and Ozone by Month

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Scatter plot with regression line
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='Temp', y='Ozone', hue='Month', data=airquality_df)
plt.title('Temperature vs Ozone Levels by Month')
plt.xlabel('Temperature (°F)')
plt.ylabel('Ozone (ppb)')
plt.show()
```


    
![Temperature vs Ozone Levels by Month](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_files/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_11_0.png){.lightbox}
    
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between **temperature (°F)** and **ozone levels (ppb)**, while also distinguishing data points by **month** (represented by different shades of color).

###### Key Insights:

1. **Positive Correlation Between Temperature and Ozone:**
   - There is a clear **positive correlation** between temperature and ozone levels. As the temperature increases, ozone levels tend to increase as well.
   - This trend is particularly evident at **temperatures above 75°F**, where the ozone levels start to rise more significantly.

2. **Ozone Increases with Higher Temperatures:**
   - Ozone levels generally remain below **50 ppb** for temperatures **below 70°F**, but as temperatures rise beyond this point, ozone levels increase, with many values exceeding **100 ppb** when the temperature reaches around **90°F** and above.
   - This indicates that **higher temperatures** contribute to higher ozone concentrations.

3. **Monthly Influence on Ozone and Temperature:**
   - The data points are colored by month, with lighter colors (Month 5 = May) representing earlier months and darker colors (Month 9 = September) representing later months.
   - In the **warmer months** (July, August, September), represented by darker shades of purple and blue, there are more instances of **high ozone levels**, particularly at temperatures above **80°F**.
   - **Lower months** (May and June), represented by lighter shades of pink, tend to have lower ozone levels overall, even at higher temperatures, which suggests a seasonal effect on ozone levels.

4. **Outliers and Extreme Ozone Levels:**
   - There are a few **outliers** where ozone levels exceed **150 ppb**, particularly for temperatures around **85°F to 90°F**. These data points mostly appear in **July and August**, indicating that extreme ozone events occur during the peak summer months.
   - The outliers reflect instances where ozone levels spike dramatically even though the temperature is not exceptionally high.

###### General Trends:

- **Temperature-Driven Ozone Formation:** The positive correlation between temperature and ozone levels suggests that **ozone formation** increases as temperatures rise, particularly during the summer months.
- **Seasonal Influence:** The coloring by month indicates a **seasonal pattern**, where ozone levels are generally higher in the later summer months (July to September) compared to earlier in the year (May and June).
- **High Ozone in Summer:** The majority of the higher ozone levels are observed in **July and August**, especially at temperatures above **80°F**, reflecting the impact of summer heat on ozone concentration.

###### Conclusion:

This scatter plot highlights the **strong relationship** between **temperature** and **ozone levels**, with higher temperatures leading to increased ozone concentrations, particularly during the **summer months**. The seasonal trend suggests that ozone levels peak during **July and August**, likely due to the combination of **higher temperatures** and **environmental conditions** that promote ozone formation. This information can be critical for air quality monitoring and predicting **ozone pollution** during the warmer months of the year.


##### Correlation Matrix of Ozone, Temp, Wind

```python
# Correlation matrix
corr = airquality_df[['Ozone', 'Temp', 'Wind']].corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```


    
![Correlation Matrix of Ozone, Temp and Wind](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_files/Tut2_Python_Karottukoikal_092024_12_0.png){.lightbox}
    
This correlation matrix visualizes the relationships between **ozone levels**, **temperature**, and **wind speed**. The matrix provides values between -1 and 1, where:
- **1** indicates a perfect positive correlation,
- **-1** indicates a perfect negative correlation, and
- **0** indicates no correlation.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Ozone and Temperature (Correlation = 0.7):**
   - There is a **strong positive correlation** of **0.7** between **ozone levels** and **temperature**.
   - This suggests that as temperature increases, ozone levels tend to increase as well. This aligns with the previous visualizations where high temperatures were associated with higher ozone concentrations.

2. **Ozone and Wind Speed (Correlation = -0.6):**
   - There is a **moderate negative correlation** of **-0.6** between **ozone levels** and **wind speed**.
   - This indicates that as wind speed increases, ozone levels tend to decrease. Wind likely disperses ozone, leading to lower concentrations.

3. **Temperature and Wind Speed (Correlation = -0.46):**
   - There is a **moderate negative correlation** of **-0.46** between **temperature** and **wind speed**.
   - This suggests that higher temperatures tend to occur when wind speeds are lower, and vice versa.

###### General Trends:

- **Strong Positive Correlation Between Ozone and Temperature:** The positive correlation between ozone and temperature indicates that ozone levels tend to rise with higher temperatures, which may be due to increased sunlight and chemical reactions that generate ozone.
  
- **Negative Correlation Between Ozone and Wind:** The negative correlation between ozone and wind suggests that windier conditions help **disperse ozone**, leading to lower concentrations.

- **Interplay of Wind and Temperature:** The negative correlation between wind speed and temperature suggests that **calmer, warmer conditions** are conducive to higher ozone levels, while **windier conditions** are typically associated with lower temperatures and lower ozone concentrations.

###### Conclusion:

The correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationship between **ozone**, **temperature**, and **wind speed**. The **strong positive correlation** between ozone and temperature suggests that hotter days lead to higher ozone concentrations, while the **negative correlation** between wind and ozone indicates that wind helps reduce ozone levels by dispersing it. This matrix highlights the complex interplay between these environmental factors, with temperature driving ozone formation and wind acting as a dispersive force.


### Friday

On Friday, I decided to go one step ahead and try these python basics on another dataset, the Swiss Dataset.

#### Overview of the Swiss Dataset

The **Swiss** dataset, originally from **RStudio**, provides standardized fertility and socio-economic data for **47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland** in 1888. This dataset is commonly used for exploring relationships between fertility rates and various socio-economic factors.

##### Dataset Structure:
The dataset consists of six variables:
1. **Fertility**: Standardized fertility measure.
2. **Agriculture**: Percentage of males involved in agriculture as an occupation.
3. **Examination**: Percentage of draftees receiving the highest mark on army examination.
4. **Education**: Percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees.
5. **Catholic**: Percentage of the population that is Catholic (a measure of religion).
6. **Infant.Mortality**: Number of live births who live less than 1 year per 1000 births.

##### Dataset Characteristics:
- The dataset contains **47 entries** (rows) for each variable.
- There are no missing values in any of the columns, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.
- The data types for the variables are primarily **float64**, except for **Examination** and **Education**, which are of type **int64**.

##### Basic Statistics:
Below are the key statistics for each variable based on the data:

- **Fertility**:

  - **Mean**: 19.94 per 1000 births
  - **Minimum**: 10.8, **Maximum**: 26.6
  - **50th percentile (median)**: 20.0

##### Key Insights:
1. **Fertility**:
   - Fertility rates range from **35 to 92.5**, with a mean of **70.14**. The median fertility is **70.4**, indicating that most provinces have moderate to high fertility rates.
   
2. **Agriculture**:
   - The percentage of males involved in agriculture varies significantly across provinces, ranging from **1.2%** to **89.7%**. The median is **54%**, showing that agriculture was a major occupation in many regions during this time.

3. **Examination and Education**:
   - The **Examination** score ranges from **3%** to **37%**, with a mean of **16.49%**, indicating that only a small portion of draftees received the highest marks.
   - The **Education** level ranges from **1%** to **53%**, with a median of **8%**, suggesting that a relatively small portion of the population had education beyond primary school.

4. **Catholic**:
   - The percentage of **Catholic** population varies significantly, from **2.15%** to **100%**, reflecting the diversity in religious adherence across the provinces. The median is **15.14%**, but the dataset includes provinces with a fully Catholic population.

5. **Infant Mortality**:
   - **Infant Mortality** ranges from **10.8** to **26.6 per 1000 births**, with a mean of **19.94**. The median is **20.0**, indicating that most provinces had similar infant mortality rates, though some had much higher rates.

##### Potential Analysis:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating how fertility is related to variables like **education, agriculture**, and **religion (Catholic)**.
- **Geographical Trends**: Analyzing how these socio-economic factors vary across different regions in Switzerland.
- **Socio-Economic Influence**: Understanding the impact of education, religion, and occupation (agriculture) on fertility and infant mortality rates.

##### Conclusion:
The **Swiss** dataset provides valuable insights into fertility rates and socio-economic factors in **47 Swiss provinces** in the late 19th century. With complete data and a range of variables, this dataset is an excellent resource for studying the relationships between **fertility**, **occupation**, **education**, **religion**, and **infant mortality** in a historical context.

This histogram visualizes the distribution of **Infant Mortality** rates (per 1000 live births) for the Swiss dataset.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Central Tendency:**
   - The **peak of the distribution** is around **20 infant deaths per 1000 births**, with the highest frequency of provinces having this mortality rate.
   - The **mean infant mortality rate** is approximately **19.94**, aligning closely with the histogram's peak.

2. **Moderate Spread:**
   - The **majority** of the data is concentrated between **18 and 22 infant deaths per 1000 births**. This indicates that most provinces had relatively similar infant mortality rates.
   - The central grouping of bars shows that most provinces had **moderate infant mortality**.

3. **Tails on Both Ends:**
   - On the **lower end**, a few provinces have relatively low infant mortality, with values around **12 to 16 per 1000 births**.
   - On the **higher end**, a few provinces have infant mortality rates reaching up to **26 per 1000 births**, but these higher mortality rates are less frequent.

4. **Outliers:**
   - There is a slight **outlier** around **12 infant deaths per 1000 births**, representing a province with significantly lower mortality than most others.
   - Similarly, provinces with **mortality rates above 24 per 1000** are relatively rare, indicating that extremely high infant mortality rates were uncommon.

###### General Trends:

- **Most provinces** in this dataset experienced **infant mortality rates between 18 and 22 per 1000 births**, showing that this range is the norm.
- There is **moderate variation** in infant mortality rates, with a few provinces at the lower and higher extremes, indicating some regional differences.

###### Conclusion:

The histogram illustrates that **infant mortality** in Swiss provinces during this period is **concentrated around 20 deaths per 1000 births**, with some variation on both ends. A few provinces experienced unusually high or low rates, but the overall trend is centered around moderate infant mortality. This provides insights into **health conditions and regional disparities** in 19th century Switzerland.


##### Distribution of Education

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.hist(swiss_df['Education'].dropna(), bins=20, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Education')
plt.xlabel('Education')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```


    
![Distribution of Education](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Swiss_Data_Analysis_files/Swiss_Data_Analysis_2_0.png){.lightbox}
This histogram visualizes the distribution of **Education** in the Swiss dataset, where **education** represents the percentage of draftees with education beyond primary school.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Bimodal Distribution:**
   - The distribution shows a **bimodal pattern**, with two clear peaks. 
   - The first peak is around **10% education**, with most provinces falling within the **0-15% range**.
   - There is a second, smaller peak around **30% education**, indicating a few provinces with significantly higher levels of education beyond primary school.

2. **Concentration at Low Education Levels:**
   - A large portion of the dataset is concentrated at **lower education levels**, particularly between **0% and 15%**. The **highest frequency** occurs between **5% and 10%**, indicating that most provinces had a relatively low percentage of draftees receiving education beyond primary school.
   - This highlights the limited access to advanced education for most provinces during this period.

3. **Gaps in Education Levels:**
   - There is a noticeable **gap** between **15% and 25%** where very few provinces fall, indicating that there were fewer provinces with moderate education levels.
   - This could suggest that provinces either had **low** or **relatively high** education levels, but not many had intermediate values.

4. **High Education Outliers:**
   - There are a few provinces with **extremely high levels of education**, with one outlier reaching **50%**. These outliers represent provinces where a significant portion of the population pursued education beyond primary school, a rarity in the dataset.

###### General Trends:

- **Majority of Provinces with Low Education Levels**: Most provinces in Switzerland during this period had **low education rates**, with the majority of values concentrated between **0% and 15%**. 
- **Higher Education Outliers**: A small number of provinces had significantly higher levels of education, particularly around **30% and 50%**, suggesting substantial regional differences in access to education.

###### Conclusion:

The histogram reveals that most provinces had **low education levels**, with few opportunities for education beyond primary school. However, a few provinces show significantly higher education rates, indicating **regional disparities** in educational attainment. This distribution underscores the **uneven access to education** in 19th-century Switzerland, where the majority of the population had limited access to further education.

##### Boxplot of Examination

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.boxplot(swiss_df['Examination'].dropna())
plt.title('Boxplot of Examination')
plt.ylabel('Examination')
plt.show()
```

This boxplot visualizes the distribution of **Examination** scores in the Swiss dataset, where **Examination** refers to the percentage of draftees receiving the highest mark in the military examination.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Median Examination Score:**
   - The **median** examination score is approximately **16%**, as indicated by the orange line in the box. This suggests that, on average, 16% of draftees in each province achieved the highest mark.

2. **Interquartile Range (IQR):**
   - The **IQR** (the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles) spans from about **12% to 22%**. This indicates that the middle 50% of the provinces had between 12% and 22% of their draftees achieving the highest marks.
   - The relatively narrow IQR suggests that most provinces had similar examination outcomes within this range.

3. **Whiskers and Data Spread:**
   - The **lower whisker** extends down to **3%**, representing the province with the lowest percentage of draftees receiving the highest examination mark.
   - The **upper whisker** extends up to **37%**, indicating that the highest-performing province had 37% of its draftees achieving the top marks.
   - The whiskers indicate that most provinces fall between **3% and 37%**, with no extreme outliers in the data.

4. **Symmetry of Distribution:**
   - The boxplot shows a relatively **balanced distribution**, with the median line close to the center of the IQR. The whiskers are roughly of equal length, indicating that the data is **not heavily skewed**.

###### General Trends:

- The **majority** of the provinces have between **12% and 22%** of draftees receiving the highest marks on the military examination.
- The examination scores do not have any outliers, suggesting that there is **consistent performance** across provinces with no extreme deviations.

###### Conclusion:

This boxplot of the **Examination** scores reveals a **moderately concentrated** distribution, with most provinces achieving similar performance. The **median score of 16%** and the spread between **3% and 37%** suggest some variation between provinces, but the overall distribution is balanced. This data provides insights into the level of military readiness and education among draftees in different provinces of Switzerland during this period.


##### Scatterplot of Fertility vs Infant Mortality by Catholic Population

```python
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.scatterplot(x='Fertility', y='Infant.Mortality', hue='Catholic', data=swiss_df)
plt.title('Fertility vs Infant Mortality by Catholic population')
plt.xlabel('Fertility')
plt.ylabel('Infant Mortality')
plt.show()
```


    
![Fertility vs Infant Mortality by Catholic Population](Python_Unit_1/Week_4_Chris/Swiss_Data_Analysis_files/Swiss_Data_Analysis_4_0.png){.lightbox}
    
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between **fertility rates** and **infant mortality** across the Swiss dataset, with the color hue representing the **percentage of Catholic population** in each province.

###### Key Insights:

1. **Positive Correlation Between Fertility and Infant Mortality:**
   - There is a **positive correlation** between **fertility** and **infant mortality**. As the fertility rate increases, infant mortality tends to increase as well. Provinces with higher fertility generally experience higher rates of infant mortality.
   - This relationship indicates that regions with more births also have higher rates of infant deaths.

2. **Impact of Catholic Population:**
   - The **color hue** represents the percentage of the population that is **Catholic**, with darker points indicating provinces with a higher percentage of Catholics.
   - Provinces with higher fertility rates and higher infant mortality (upper right portion of the plot) tend to have a **higher Catholic population** (darker points). This suggests that provinces with a larger Catholic population tend to have higher fertility and infant mortality rates.
   - In contrast, provinces with lower fertility and lower infant mortality (lower left portion) generally have a **lower Catholic population** (lighter points).

3. **Concentration of Points Around Median Fertility:**
   - A significant number of points are concentrated between **fertility rates of 60 and 80** and **infant mortality rates between 18 and 22**. These central values suggest that many provinces fall within this range, indicating a moderate relationship between fertility and infant mortality.
   - Provinces with these mid-range values are spread across different levels of Catholic population, showing diversity in religious composition within this group.

4. **Outliers:**
   - Some provinces with extremely high fertility rates (**above 80**) and high infant mortality rates (**above 24**) are outliers, and they tend to have a high percentage of Catholic population.
   - On the lower end, a few provinces with **low fertility rates (below 50)** and **low infant mortality** also stand out as exceptions.

###### General Trends:

- **Higher Catholic Population**: Provinces with a higher percentage of Catholics tend to exhibit both **higher fertility rates** and **higher infant mortality**.
- **Moderate Fertility and Mortality Range**: Most provinces are concentrated around **60-80 fertility** and **18-22 infant mortality**, with varying Catholic population percentages.
- **Religious Influence**: The distribution of Catholic population suggests a potential cultural or socio-economic influence on fertility and infant mortality trends.

###### Conclusion:

This scatter plot highlights a **positive correlation** between **fertility** and **infant mortality**, with provinces that have a **higher Catholic population** generally showing higher rates in both metrics. This relationship suggests that religious and cultural factors might play a role in shaping fertility and infant health outcomes in Swiss provinces. Further analysis could explore whether this pattern is driven by socio-economic factors or access to healthcare.

##### Correlation Matrix of Catholic Population, Education and Infant Mortality

This correlation matrix shows the relationships between three variables from the Swiss dataset: **Catholic** (percentage of Catholic population), **Education** (percentage of education beyond primary school for draftees), and **Infant Mortality** (infant deaths per 1000 live births).

###### Key Insights:

1. **Catholic and Infant Mortality (0.18):**
   - There is a **positive correlation** of **0.18** between the **Catholic population** and **Infant Mortality**. While this is a weak correlation, it suggests that provinces with a higher percentage of Catholics tend to have slightly higher infant mortality rates.
   - This positive correlation could be linked to cultural, religious, or socio-economic factors in predominantly Catholic regions that may affect infant mortality rates.

2. **Catholic and Education (-0.15):**
   - There is a **negative correlation** of **-0.15** between **Catholic population** and **Education**. Although the correlation is weak, it indicates that provinces with a higher percentage of Catholics tend to have slightly lower levels of education beyond primary school.
   - This trend might reflect historical or cultural differences in access to education in Catholic regions.

3. **Education and Infant Mortality (-0.099):**
   - The **correlation between Education and Infant Mortality** is **-0.099**, which is also weak but negative. This indicates that provinces with higher levels of education tend to have slightly lower infant mortality rates.
   - This finding suggests that increased education may have a minor protective effect on infant mortality, likely due to better healthcare knowledge or socioeconomic conditions associated with higher education levels.

###### General Observations:

- **Weak Correlations**: All correlations in the matrix are relatively weak (close to 0), indicating that there is no strong linear relationship between these variables. The weak positive correlation between **Catholic** and **Infant Mortality** is the highest, but still not strong.
- **Cultural and Socio-Economic Factors**: The relationships between Catholicism, education, and infant mortality may be influenced by a variety of socio-economic and cultural factors that are not fully captured by these simple correlations.

###### Conclusion:

This correlation matrix reveals **weak associations** between **Catholic population**, **education**, and **infant mortality**. The slightly positive correlation between **Catholicism** and **infant mortality** suggests a possible link worth further investigation, while the negative correlation between **education** and **infant mortality** aligns with expectations that higher education may contribute to better health outcomes. However, the weak correlations indicate that other factors likely play a significant role in shaping these relationships.

### Week 4 Conclusion 

#### Python Basics and Data Analysis

This week, we focused on several fundamental and advanced Python concepts, particularly in the context of data analysis, using libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Here’s a breakdown of the key areas covered:

##### 1. Python Lists & Arrays
- Practiced working with basic Python lists and `numpy` arrays for handling numerical computations.
- Reinforced foundational Python skills by manipulating lists and performing basic array operations.

```python
# Example of using numpy arrays
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

##### 2. DataFrames with Pandas
- Explored `pandas` for creating and manipulating dataframes.
- Extracted statistics from datasets and analyzed their structure using key functions like `describe()` and `info()`.

```python
# Creating a dataframe
import pandas as pd
data = {'Ozone': [41, 36, 12], 'Temp': [67, 72, 74]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.describe())
```

##### 3. Airquality Dataset Analysis
- **Overview**: Analyzed air quality data in New York from May to September 1973, focusing on variables like ozone, temperature, and wind speed.
- **Visualizations**: Created histograms and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between these variables.
- **Key Insights**:
    - Higher temperatures correlated with higher ozone levels.
    - Wind speeds showed a negative correlation with ozone concentration.
    - Missing values in Ozone and Solar Radiation were identified as needing further handling.

```python
# Scatter plot of Temperature vs Ozone Levels
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.scatterplot(x='Temp', y='Ozone', data=df)
plt.show()
```

##### 4. Swiss Dataset Analysis
- **Overview**: Explored fertility and socio-economic factors in 47 Swiss provinces from 1888, examining variables like fertility, education, and Catholic population percentages.
- **Visualizations**: Created visualizations like histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution of variables such as education and infant mortality.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated relationships between fertility, infant mortality, and Catholic population using a correlation matrix.
- **Key Insights**:
    - Higher fertility rates correlated with higher infant mortality.
    - Catholic provinces tended to show higher fertility and infant mortality.
    - Education was inversely correlated with infant mortality.

```python
# Correlation Matrix Heatmap
corr = df[['Catholic', 'Education', 'Infant.Mortality']].corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
plt.show()
```

#### Conclusion
This week was an in-depth exploration of Python’s capabilities for data analysis, focusing on extracting meaningful insights from real-world datasets. The work demonstrated strong relationships between environmental and socio-economic variables, using visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover trends. These skills are essential for further data-driven projects, offering opportunities for deeper exploration of historical datasets and environmental data.



## Week 5 - 09/23 ~ 09/27


### Wednesday

#### Plotnine Tutorial: Understanding the Grammar of Graphics

##### 1. Introduction to Plotnine

plotnine is a data visualization package for Python based on the Grammar of Graphics, which is a system for understanding and building plots. The grammar describes how plots are constructed by combining data, aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and other components.

To begin, you’ll need to install the plotnine package if you don’t have it installed:

```bash
pip install plotnine
```

##### 2. The Grammar of Graphics

The Grammar of Graphics consists of the following key components:

- Data: The data you want to visualize.  
- Aesthetics (aes): How the data is mapped to visual properties, such as x and y coordinates, color, size, etc.  
- Geometries (geom): The type of plot, like points, lines, bars, etc.  
- Facets: Subplots based on the data.  
- Scales: Control the mapping from data to aesthetic properties.  
- Coordinate systems: Adjust how data is projected on the plane (Cartesian, rotations, polar, etc.).  
- Themes: Adjust the non-data elements like background, labels, gridlines, etc.  

##### 3. Creating Your First Plot

Let’s begin by creating a simple scatter plot using the famous mtcars dataset. We’ll show how to set up the basic structure and gradually build complexity.


```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_point, labs

# Load the mtcars dataset
mtcars = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/mtcars.csv')
mtcars.info()

# Create a basic scatter plot
p1 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='wt', y='mpg')) +
 geom_point() +
 labs(title='Scatter Plot of MPG vs Weight',
      x='Weight (1000 lbs)',
      y='Miles per Gallon'))
p1.save("ScatterPlot_MPG_Weight.png")
```

##### 4. Adding Aesthetic Mappings

In the Grammar of Graphics, aesthetics control how data points are represented visually. You can map variables to size, color, shape, and more.

###### Example: Color by cyl (number of cylinders)


```python
p2 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='wt', y='mpg', color='factor(cyl)')) +
 geom_point() +
 labs(title='MPG vs Weight by Cylinder',
      x='Weight (1000 lbs)',
      y='Miles per Gallon',
      color='Cylinders'))
p2.save("MPG_Weight_Cylinder.png")
```

    c:\users\chris\desktop\oru folder\fall 2024\gcsc 577\group4\python_unit_1\week_4_chris\venv477\lib\site-packages\plotnine\ggplot.py:606: PlotnineWarning: Saving 6.4 x 4.8 in image.

![MPG vs Weight by Cylinder and Horsepower](./Python_Unit_2/Week5_Chris/MPG_Weight_Cyl_HP.png){.lightbox}


##### 5. Geometric Objects

geom_* specifies the type of plot. You can create scatter plots, line charts, bar plots, histograms, etc.

###### Example: Adding a smooth line (geom_smooth)


```python
from plotnine import geom_smooth

p4 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='wt', y='mpg')) +
 geom_point() +
 geom_smooth(method='lm') +  # Linear regression line
 labs(title='MPG vs Weight with Regression Line',
      x='Weight (1000 lbs)',
      y='Miles per Gallon'))
p4.save("MPG_Weight_Regression.png")
```

    c:\users\chris\desktop\oru folder\fall 2024\gcsc 577\group4\python_unit_1\week_4_chris\venv477\lib\site-packages\plotnine\ggplot.py:606: PlotnineWarning: Saving 6.4 x 4.8 in image.

![MPG vs Weight with Regression Line](./Python_Unit_2/Week5_Chris/MPG_Weight_Regression.png){.lightbox}


##### 6. Faceting

Faceting allows you to split your plot into multiple panels based on a factor.

###### Example: Facet by cyl


```python
from plotnine import facet_wrap

p5 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='wt', y='mpg')) +
 geom_point() +
 facet_wrap('~cyl') +  # Split into subplots by cylinders
 labs(title='MPG vs Weight Faceted by Cylinder',
      x='Weight (1000 lbs)',
      y='Miles per Gallon'))
p5.save("MPG_Weight_Faceted.png")
```

    c:\users\chris\desktop\oru folder\fall 2024\gcsc 577\group4\python_unit_1\week_4_chris\venv477\lib\site-packages\plotnine\ggplot.py:606: PlotnineWarning: Saving 6.4 x 4.8 in image.

![MPG vs Weight Faceted by Cylinder](./Python_Unit_2/Week5_Chris/MPG_Weight_Faceted.png){.lightbox}


##### 7. Customizing Scales

Scales control the mapping from data to aesthetic attributes. You can customize scales for color, size, and more.

###### Example: Custom Color Scale


```python
from plotnine import scale_color_manual

p6 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='wt', y='mpg', color='factor(cyl)')) +
 geom_point() +
 scale_color_manual(values=['#1e07bf', '#fe0f0f', '#2e002f']) +  # Custom colors
 labs(title='MPG vs Weight with Custom Colors',
      x='Weight (1000 lbs)',
      y='Miles per Gallon',
      color='Cylinders'))

p6.save("MPG_Weight_CustomColors.png")
```

    c:\users\chris\desktop\oru folder\fall 2024\gcsc 577\group4\python_unit_1\week_4_chris\venv477\lib\site-packages\plotnine\ggplot.py:606: PlotnineWarning: Saving 6.4 x 4.8 in image.

![MPG vs Weight with Custom Colors](./Python_Unit_2/Week5_Chris/MPG_Weight_CustomColors.png){.lightbox}


##### 8. Flip Coordinates

Create a bar plot showing distribution of cylinders


###### Example: Fliping coordinates axis


```python
from plotnine import geom_bar, coord_flip

# Create a bar plot showing distribution of cylinders
p7 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='factor(cyl)', fill='factor(cyl)')) +
 geom_bar(width=1) +
 coord_flip() +  # Flip coordinates as a simple workaround
 labs(title='Distribution of Cylinders',
      x='Cylinders',
      fill='Cylinders'))
p7.save("Dist_Cyl.png")
```

    c:\users\chris\desktop\oru folder\fall 2024\gcsc 577\group4\python_unit_1\week_4_chris\venv477\lib\site-packages\plotnine\ggplot.py:606: PlotnineWarning: Saving 6.4 x 4.8 in image.

##### 9. Themes

Themes allow you to adjust the non-data aspects of the plot, such as background, axis labels, and gridlines.

###### Example: Apply a Minimal Theme


```python
from plotnine import theme_minimal

p8 = (ggplot(mtcars, aes(x='wt', y='mpg')) +
 geom_point() +
 theme_minimal() +  # Minimalistic theme
 labs(title='MPG vs Weight with Minimal Theme',
      x='Weight (1000 lbs)',
      y='Miles per Gallon'))
p8.save("Minimal_Theme.png")
```

    c:\users\chris\desktop\oru folder\fall 2024\gcsc 577\group4\python_unit_1\week_4_chris\venv477\lib\site-packages\plotnine\ggplot.py:606: PlotnineWarning: Saving 6.4 x 4.8 in image.

#### Parental Education and Early STEM Interest

![Parental Education vs Early STEM Interest](./Python_Unit_2/Week5_Chris/Parental_Education_vs_Early_STEM_Interest.png){.lightbox}

This visualization examines the relationship between **parental education levels** and **students' early interest in STEM fields** (math and science). While higher parental education, particularly **Doctorate/Professional degrees**, is associated with more consistent interest in STEM, there is **moderate variation** across all education levels, suggesting that other factors also influence STEM interest.

The findings highlight the role of **parental education** in fostering early STEM interest, contributing to the project's goal of understanding the **correlation between early STEM exposure and STEM career choices**. The wide range of interest across education levels suggests that **school** or **personal motivation** may also be significant, pointing to opportunities for interventions, such as **targeted STEM programs**, to nurture interest across **diverse family backgrounds**.


#### Dataset Context - HSLS Data

The dataset is drawn from the **High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)**, which tracks a cohort of students who entered 9th grade in the fall of 2009. The study captures detailed data on students' academic achievements, interests, attitudes, and family and school characteristics, with a particular focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields. The dataset includes measures on math and science performance, parental occupation, student demographics, and self-reported attitudes towards STEM subjects. You can find out more [here](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/index.asp){target="_blank"}


###### Data Source

- **Source:** The dataset originates from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a U.S. government organization that collects and analyzes educational data. The data is publicly available through NCES’s website and is widely used for educational research and policy evaluation.
- **Survey:** HSLS:09, a comprehensive survey of U.S. high school students with follow-ups tracking their progress through high school, into postsecondary education, and into the workforce.

###### 30 Columns and Randomized Data

We meticulously selected 30 columns representing key aspects of STEM participation, demographic factors, academic performance, and parental influence to analyze the impact of various factors on students' STEM trajectories. These columns were chosen to enable analysis of the relationships between student performance in STEM subjects, family background, self-perception, and eventual aspirations in STEM careers.

#### The 5 W's Breakdown

##### 1. **Who (Who does the data represent?)**
   - **Who:** The data represents students who began 9th grade in 2009 in public and private schools across the United States. It includes information on the students, their families, teachers, and schools.
   - **Population:** The dataset covers a diverse cross-section of U.S. students, including different races, income levels, genders, and academic achievements.

##### 2. **When (When was the data collected?)**
   - **When:** The baseline data collection occurred in 2009, with follow-up surveys conducted later as the students progressed through high school and beyond. This timeline allows us to observe students' academic growth and career trajectories.
   - **Specific Timeframes:**
      - **Baseline:** Fall 2009 (9th grade).
      - **Follow-up waves:** Conducted in subsequent years to track academic progress and STEM involvement.

##### 3. **Where (Where was the data collected?)**
   - **Where:** The dataset covers schools in the United States across various regions, including urban, suburban, and rural areas. The dataset includes school-level identifiers, allowing for analysis of geographic or school-specific trends in STEM education.
   - **Schools:** Public and private schools in different locales (urban, suburban, and rural).

##### 4. **What (What does the dataset include?)**
   - **What:** The dataset includes a wide range of variables on student academic performance, demographic information, family background, school resources, and student attitudes towards STEM subjects.
      - **Key Data Fields:**
         - **Demographics:** Student gender (X1SEX), race/ethnicity (X1RACE), family income (X1FAMINCOME), and parental education (X1PAREDU).
         - **STEM Participation:** Interest in math (X1MTHINT) and science (X1SCIINT), math self-efficacy (X1MTHEFF), parental occupation in STEM fields (X1PAR1OCC_STEM1), and more.
         - **Performance:** Math and science test scores (X1TXMTH, X1SCIEFF), proficiency levels (X1TXMPROF1 to X1TXMPROF5), and school engagement (X1SCHOOLENG).
         - **Parental Influence:** Parental occupation and education levels (X1PAREDU, X1PAR1OCC_STEM1).

##### 5. **Why (Why was the data collected? Why are we analyzing these columns?)**
   - **Why:** The HSLS:09 dataset was collected to understand how students’ academic experiences, particularly in STEM fields, evolve over time. It explores how family background, school resources, and self-perceptions affect students' performance and career aspirations, especially in STEM-related fields.
      - **Purpose of Analysis:**
         - **To analyze:** The chosen columns allow us to study the relationship between student demographics (gender, race), academic performance in math and science, and future STEM aspirations.
         - **To uncover:** How parental STEM occupations or educational backgrounds influence students' interest and success in STEM, and whether specific demographic groups are underrepresented in STEM participation.

##### 6. **How (How is the data structured and how will we use it?)**
   - **How:** The dataset is structured into variables representing both categorical (e.g., gender, race) and continuous (e.g., math scores, family income) data. The data is collected from students, their parents, schools, and teachers.
      - **Data Analysis:**
         - We will create visualizations that can help correlate STEM performance with demographic variables, family influences, and student self-efficacy in math and science.

#### Conclusion

The chosen 30 columns provide a comprehensive view of student, family, and school characteristics, making it possible to explore STEM participation trends through factors such as demographics, academic performance, family influence, and self-perception. By leveraging these insights, we aim to identify gaps in STEM education and propose strategies to increase participation among underrepresented groups.
